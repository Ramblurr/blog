<h1>IT'S RAINING IN LOVE</h1>
<pre class="poem">
I don't know what it is,
But I distrust myself
When I start to like a girl
	A lot.

It makes me nervous.
I don't say the right things
Or perhaps I start
	To examine,
		Evaluate,
			Compute
	What I am saying.

If I say, "Do you think it's going to rain?"
and she says, "I don't know,"
I start thinking:  Does she really like me?

In other words
I get a little creepy.

A friend of mine once said,
"It's twenty times better to be friends
	with someone
than it is to be in love with them."

I think he's right and besides,
its raining somewhere, programming flowers
and keeping snails happy.
	That's all taken care of.

		BUT
if a girl likes me a lot
and starts getting real nervous
and suddenly begins asking me funny questions
and looks sad if I give the wrong answers
and she says things like,
"Do you think it's going to rain?"
and I say, "It beats me,"
and she says, "Oh,"
and looks a little sad
at the clear blue California sky,
I think:  Thank God, it's you, baby, this time
	Instead of me.
