<strong>Short version</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/Ramblurr" title="My Public Twitter Account">@Ramblurr</a> is my new public Tech/FOSS twitter account, please follow it.

I have been on twitter for quite awhile, for several years at least. My original use case for twitter was something like a web/sms based IRC channel for my good friends from my hometown. Twitter is responsible for keeping us close in the years after we parted ways for different colleges. This use case worked great until my online communities (KDE, tech industry, etc) started jumping aboard the twitter boat.

At first I tried to handle both social spheres—online professional, and raucous college student—with the same account. Needless to say one group did not appreciate the drunken tweets or lengthy star wars quotation contests, and the other group did not appreciate my Java vs C++ discussions. Eventually, I made my account private and left the online technology twitter sphere, but now things are changing. 

Twitter has risen to prominence in the online community, and I am missing out on this form of social communication with my fellow technology and open source enthusiasts. So, I've renamed my <a href="https://twitter.com/rmblr" title="Private Twitter Account"> private account</a>, and opened my original for public use.

Please feel free to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Ramblurr" title="My Public Twitter Account">@Ramblurr</a>, my public account, without need to fear a flood of inane, hyper-context-sensitive, ramblings between friends.
