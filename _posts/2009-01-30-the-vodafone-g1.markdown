I'm writing this post from my G1 (thanks to the PostBot wordpress application) in Cairo, Egypt using Vodafone Egypt's 3G service.

Before coming over I was told (by T-mobile) that my phone absolutely would not work, because the G1 only works with the "google network" that T-Mobile has exclusive access to. Without this "google network", I was told, my phone wouldn't turn on and was essentially a paper weight (exact words). Yeah right.

I convinced the customer service representative to give me my unlock code (which you are entitled to after 90 days of service), and told her I didn't want the outrageous international plan (15$/megabyte).  Note: it takes 1 or 2 days for the unlock code request to be processed and emailed to you.

Getting my G1 working in Egypt was quite simple. I bought a prepaid sim card from one of the Vodafone shops you'll find on every street (literally) for 45 L.E. (approx. $6) and a 100 L.E. (approx $17) card for 100 minutes.

After putting the simcard in and powering up the phone, I was greeted with an unlock dialog into which I entered the T-Mobile unlock code. Poof! Instant cellular access. 3G service was slightly more complicated. You have to add a new APN in the mobile network settings.

<strong>Instructions for adding the Vodafone Egypt APN </strong>
<ol>
<li> Open <em> Settings > Wireless Controls > Mobile Networks > Access Point Names </em></li>
<li> Click <em>Menu > Add APN </em></li>
<li> Enter the following information
<strong>Name:</strong> Vodafone Internet
<strong>APN:</strong> internet.vodafone.net
<strong>User:</strong> internet
<strong>Pass:</strong> internet
<strong>APN type:</strong> default
</li>
<li> Leave every other field at the default setting </li>
<li> Reboot the phone </li>
<li> Enjoy 3G service </li>
</ol>

My hands are cramping from writing this post on the tiny keyboard. Pardon any spelling/grammar mistakes. My hands are done.
