I've been slacking on the update reports over the past two weeks, because I'm holding out for the exciting post where I say "MP3tunes AutoSync is working! Huzzah!" Sadly, this report isn't that one.

For the past week I've been banging my head against the wall of glib, QtEventLoop, and QThreads. I have quite a headache to say the least, but yesterday thanks to <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/blog/categories/18-freespirit">my mentor</a> and <a href="http://www.monroe.nu/">Ian</a>, both Amarok developers, my head actually broke through that wall. Literally. GLIB, and Qt are kowtowing at my feet swearing oaths of fealty. They have promised to work together and let me get back to doing fun things, like code new features.
