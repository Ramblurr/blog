The beginning of a new book is like the beginning of a relationship; you don't quite know what to expect. Hopefully not too much time passes before you become acquainted, and then it's not very long until you are intimately familiar with each other. The good ones don't get old, because, while perhaps each page turn/day passing doesn't reveal something exciting, you can't put it down. There's something special there.
