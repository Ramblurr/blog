Things have been busy around here! First, there was the end-of-semester rush that occurs right before exams, then there was exams themselves. After the 3-day cross country drive home, I've spent the last couple weeks playing Settlers of Cataan with old friends, and hitting the ski slopes a couple times a week.

In between all that I haven't had much time for development. Actually, I told a small lie. I've been pretty busy with a secret project (tm), but I can't post anything about that until the 19th.

Amarok wise, things are looking up. I've started to completely refactor the last.fm service in Amarok 2. Expect a more explanatory post (plus screenshots!) soon. 

Finally, Camp KDE is a few short days away. During the conference <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/blog/categories/20-lfranchi" title="lfranchi">Leo Franchi</a> and I plan to knock out some huge improvmeents to Amarok 2's Context View.

Gah, Gah, Go, that's all folks!
