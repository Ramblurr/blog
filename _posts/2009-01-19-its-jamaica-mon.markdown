The "conference" ended yesterday as the final presentations were given, however we still have 4 days left here among the sunny beaches.  Today <a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/blog/432" title="Till Adam's Blog">Till Adam</a> gave a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/3210990772/" title="Never lecture without your towel">fantastic</a> lecture-slash-hands-on-workshop of Qt's Model/View and plugin architecture. Just a couple weeks ago I was slamming my head against the desk trying to wrap my head around Qt's M/V concepts, the results of which can be seen in Amarok's new last.fm service browser. Through the creative use of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/3210988802/" title="Visual Evidence">roleplaying</a> (thanks Ade, Jeff, Sebas, and Leo!) and two helpful hands-on exercises I've finally gotten a decent grasp of the system. Tomorrow morning we hope to sip QtConcurrent knowledge from the cup that is Till.

I'd write more, but the ocean is calling and I still need to get a Pina Colada. But before I go, check out <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ramblurr/sets/72157612763904188/">some photos</a> from the past couple days.
