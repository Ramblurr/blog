The internet is on the fritz here in Negril, Jamaica at Camp KDE, but while it is working I'll post this photo taken from the balcony during lunch.

This is also a field test of the Wordpress Android application. 

We have had 3 presentations so far. Right now Sebastian KÃ¼gler is giving a great talk concerning optimizing your applications for mobile devices.

More quality updates soon.<br/>
