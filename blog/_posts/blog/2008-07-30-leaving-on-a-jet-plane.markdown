The ball has been dropped by me - dropped hard - during the past several weeks. First, I was stumped for a week and a half by the glib+qt fiasco, then my development machine's hard drive shuffled off the mortal coil. Replacing it took a solid week, and when it finally arrived I installed Gentoo. Two days later, the finally install completes as I'm frantically throwing my life's possessions into a car:
<ul>
	<li>clothes</li>

	<li>2 laptops</li>

	<li>1 Target desk (retail $50)</li>

	<li>assorted books</li>

	<li>1 blow-up air mattress</li>
</ul>
Fast forward through seven hours of me hurtling down the interstate at not-so-safe velocities, and here I am, pardoning my recent idleness as my flight to Paris boards at gate D32. Not accomplishing much over the past several weeks suddenly doesn't seem so bad: I'm going to Europe! There is a week long hack-a-thon at Akademy; I'll catch up then.
