                <div class="entry">
                    <p>If there was a blogger award for &ldquo;Most likely to make timely posts&rdquo;, then in no possible world would I even be considered for the award. I could list some <acronym title="School">excuses</acronym> <acronym title="Travel">that</acronym> <acronym title="Life">sound</acronym> <acronym title="Moving In">legit</acronym> in my head, but the real reason I don&rsquo;t feel motivated to post often (or on time) is because I&rsquo;d rather spend that time in Google Reader reading everyone else&rsquo;s exciting content (that was not sarcastic).</p>

<p>So, lets see&hellip; last time I posted I was en route to Akademy 2008 (the KDE developers conference). That was July 30th, now, a month and a half later I am back from Europe (which was amazing), GSoC is over (sad), and class has started (jury&rsquo;s still out).</p>

<p><strong>Current Status of the MP3tunes Amarok Service</strong></p>

<p>The Good (Works)</p>

<ul>
<li>Browsing & Streaming</li>
<li>Querymaker is as functional as possible with the current API</li>
<li>Manual Downloading from MP3tunes to Local Collection</li>
<li>Manual Uploading from any Collection to MP3tunes</li>
</ul>


<p>The Bad (Doesn&rsquo;t work)</p>

<ul>
<li>AutoSync - 80%- <em>The code is there, however there are problems with the daemon not receiving signals from the MP3tunes' servers</em></li>
<li>MP3tunes playlists support - 0%- <em>Never got started on this</em></li>
</ul>


<p>The Ugly</p>

<p>There is one large issue I am still wrestling with. The details of the issue are complicated, but essentially it deals with the way Amarok handles remote tracks in playlists across sessions. Generally, remote tracks' metadata isn&rsquo;t cached by Amarok for use between multiple sessions. So, if you add an mp3tunes track to a playlist in Amarok, then restart Amarok and try to play that playlist the mp3tunes track is blank. Now, there exists a method for retrieving that metadata, however it was originally implemented synchronously. When you are retrieving metadata for any significant number of tracks (10+) synchronously, and each one of those retreivals is an HTTP Get request you end up blocking the GUI thread. At Akademy I hacked a way to do this asynchronously, but it is a really nasty hack. I&rsquo;ve got code on my computer that implements this feature correctly, but it has the nasty habit of crashing Amarok every so often.</p>

<p>Between classes, marching band, homework, and other responsibilities I&rsquo;m working on getting this ironed out and committed. Hopefully this will happen before the 2.0 release, because right now using MP3tunes in Amarok across sessions is slow and annoying.</p>
