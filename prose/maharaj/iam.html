<h2 class="likechapterHead"><a
 id="x1-2000"></a>Foreword</h2>  <a
 id="Q1-1-3"></a> <a
 id="x1-2000doc"></a>That there should be yet another addition of I AM THAT
is not surprising, for the sublimity of the words spoken by Sri
Nisargadatta Maharaj, their directness and the lucidity with which
they refer to the Highest have already made this book a literature of
paramount importance. In fact, many regard it as the only book of
spiritual teaching really worth studying.
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >There are various religions and systems of philosophy which claim to
endow human life with meaning. But they suffer from certain inherent
limitations. They couch into fine-sounding words their traditional
beliefs and ideologies, theological or philosophical. Believers, however,
discover the limited range of meaning and applicability of these words,
sooner or later. They get disillusioned and tend to abandon the
systems, in the same way as scientific theories are abandoned, when
they are called in question by too much contradictory empirical
data.
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >When a system of spiritual interpretation turns out to be unconvincing
and not capable of being rationally justified, many people allow
themselves to be converted to some other system. After a while,
however, they find limitations and contradictions in the other system
also. In this unrewarding pursuit of acceptance and rejection what
remains for them is only scepticism and agnosticism, leading to a
fatuous way of living, engrossed in mere gross utilities of life, just

consuming material goods. Sometimes, however, though rarely,
scepticism gives rise to an intuition of a basic reality, more fundamental
than that of words, religions or philosophic systems. Strangely,
it is a positive aspect of scepticism. It was in such a state of
scepticism, but also having an intuition of the basic reality, that I
happened to read Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj&#8217;s I AM THAT. I was
at once struck by the finality and unassailable certitude of his
words. Limited by their very nature though words are, I found
the utterances of Maharaj transparent, polished windows, as it
were.
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >No book of spiritual teachings, however, can replace the presence of the
teacher himself. Only the words spoken directly to you by the Guru
shed their opacity completely. In a Guru&#8217;s presence the last boundaries
drawn by the mind vanish. Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is indeed such a
Guru. He is not a preacher, but he provides precisely those indications
which the seeker needs. The reality which emanates from him is
inalienable and Absolute. It is authentic. Having experienced the verity
of his words in the pages of I AM THAT, and being inspired by it,
many from the West have found their way to Maharaj to seek
enlightenment.
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >Maharaj&#8217;s interpretation of truth is not different from that of
Jnana Yoga/Advaita Vedanta. But, he has a way of his own. The
multifarious forms around us, says he, are constituted of the five
elements. They are transient, and in a state of perpetual flux. Also
they are governed by the law of causation. All this applies to
the body and the mind also, both of which are transient and
subject to birth and death. We know that only by means of the
bodily senses and the mind can the world be known. As in the
Kantian view, it is a correlate of the human knowing subject, and,
therefore, has the fundamental structure of our way of knowing.
This means that time, space and causality are not &#8216;objective&#8217;, or
extraneous entities, but mental categories in which everything is

moulded. The existence and form of all things depend upon the
mind. Cognition is a mental product. And the world as seen
from the mind is a subjective and private world, which changes
continuously in accordance with the restlessness of the mind
itself.
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >In opposition to the restless mind, with its limited categories &#8211;
intentionality, subjectivity, duality etc. &#8211; stands supreme the limitless
sense of &#8216;I am&#8217;. The only thing I can be sure about is that &#8216;I am&#8217;; not as
a thinking &#8216;I am&#8217; in the Cartesian sense, but without any predicates.
Again and again Maharaj draws our attention to this basic fact in
order to make us realise our &#8216;I am-ness&#8217; and thus get rid of all self-made
prisons. He says: The only true statement is &#8216;I am&#8217;. All else is
mere inference. By no effort can you change the &#8216;I am&#8217; into &#8216;I
am-not&#8217;.
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >Behold, the real experiencer is not the mind, but myself, the light in
which everything appears. Self is the common factor at the root
of all experience, the awareness in which everything happens.
The entire field of consciousness is only as a film, or a speck, in
&#8216;I am&#8217;. This &#8216;I am-ness&#8217; is, being conscious of consciousness,
being aware of itself. And it is indescribable, because it has no
attributes. It is only being my self, and being my self is all that there
is. Everything that exists, exists as my self. There is nothing
which is different from me. There is no duality and, therefore, no
pain.
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >There are no problems. It is the sphere of love, in which everything is
perfect. What happens, happens spontaneously, without intentions &#8211;
like digestion, or the growth of the hair. Realise this, and be free from
the limitations of the mind.
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >Behold, the deep sleep in which there is no notion of being this or
that. Yet &#8216;I am&#8217; remains. And behold the eternal now. Memory

seems to being things to the present out of the past, but all
that happens does happen in the present only. It is only in the
timeless now that phenomena manifest themselves. Thus, time and
causality do not apply in reality. I am prior to the world, body and
mind.
<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >I am the sphere in which they appear and disappear. I am the source of
them all, the universal power by which the world with its bewildering
diversity becomes manifest.
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >In spite of its primevality, however, the sense of &#8216;I am&#8217; is not the
Highest. It is not the Absolute. The sense, or taste of &#8216;I am-ness&#8217; is not
absolutely beyond time. Being the essence of the five elements, it, in a
way, depends upon the world. It arises from the body, which, in its
turn, is built by food, consisting of the elements. It disappears when
the body dies, like the spark extinguishes when the incense stick burns
out. When pure awareness is attained, no need exists any more, not
even for &#8216;I am&#8217;, which is but a useful pointer, a direction-indicator
towards the Absolute. The awareness &#8216;I am&#8217; then easily ceases.
What prevails is that which cannot be described, that which is
beyond words. It is this &#8216;state&#8217; which is most real, a state of pure
potentiality, which is prior to everything. The &#8216;I am&#8217; and the universe
are mere reflections of it. It is this reality which a jnani has
realised.
<!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >The best that you can do is listen attentively to the jnani &#8211; of whom
Sri Nisargadatta is a living example &#8211; and to trust and believe him. By
such listening you will realise that his reality is your reality. He
helps you in seeing the nature of the world and of the &#8216;I am&#8217;.
He urges you to study the workings of the body and the mind
with solemn and intense concentration, to recognise that you are
neither of them and to cast them off. He suggests that you return
again and again to &#8216;I am&#8217; until it is your only abode, outside of
which nothing exists; until the ego as a limitation of &#8216;I am&#8217;, has

disappeared. It is then that the highest realisation will just happen
effortlessly.
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >Mark the words of the jnani, which cut across all concepts and dogmas.
Maharaj says: &#8220;until once becomes self-realised, attains to knowledge of

are provided, all these concepts.&#8221; Yes, they are concepts, even &#8216;I am&#8217; is,
but surely there are no concepts more precious. It is for the seeker to
regard them with the utmost seriousness, because they indicate the
Highest Reality. No better concepts are available to shed all
concepts.

<h2 class="likechapterHead"><a
 id="x1-3000"></a>Who is Nisargadatta Maharaj?</h2>  <a
 id="Q1-1-5"></a> When asked about the date of his
birth the Master replied blandly that he was never born!
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >Writing a biographical note on Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is a
frustrating and unrewarding task. For, not only the exact date
of his birth is unknown, but no verified facts concerning the
early years of his life are available. However, some of his elderly
relatives and friends say that he was born in the month of March
1897 on a full moon day, which coincided with the festival of
Hanuman Jayanti, when Hindus pay their homage to Hanuman,
also named Maruti, the monkey-god of Ramayana fame. And to
associate his birth with this auspicious day his parents named him
Maruti.
<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" >Available information about his boyhood and early youth is patchy
and disconnected. We learn that his father, Shivrampant, was a
poor man, who worked for some time as a domestic servant in
Bombay and, later, eked out his livelihood as a petty farmer at
Kandalgaon, a small village in the back woods of Ratnagiri district of
Maharashtra. Maruti grew up almost without education. As
a boy he assisted his father in such labours as lay within his
power &#8211; tended cattle, drove oxen, worked in the fields and ran
errands. His pleasures were simple, as his labours, but he was gifted
with an inquisitive mind, bubbling over with questions of all

sorts.
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >His father had a Brahmin friend named Vishnu Haribhau Gore, who
was a pious man and learned too from rural standards. Gore
often talked about religious topics and the boy Maruti listened
attentively and dwelt on these topics far more than anyone would
suppose. Gore was for him the ideal man &#8211; earnest, kind and
wise.
<!--l. 130--><p class="noindent" >When Maruti attained the age of eighteen his father died, leaving
behind his widow, four sons and two daughters. The meagre income
from the small farm dwindled further after the old man&#8217;s death and
was not sufficient to feed so many mouths. Maruti&#8217;s elder brother left
the village for Bombay in search of work and he followed shortly after.
It is said that in Bombay he worked for a few months as a low-paid
junior clerk in an office, but resigned the job in disgust. He then took
petty trading as a haberdasher and started a shop for selling children&#8217;s
clothes, tobacco and hand-made country cigarettes. This business is
said to have flourished in course of time, giving him some sort of
financial security. During this period he got married and had a son and
three daughters.
<!--l. 132--><p class="noindent" >Childhood, youth, marriage, progeny &#8211; Maruti lived the usual
humdrum and eventless life of a common man till his middle age, with
no inkling at all of the sainthood that was to follow. Among his friends
during this period was one Yashwantrao Baagkar, who was a devotee of
Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj, a spiritual teacher of the Navnath
Sampradaya, a sect of Hinduism.
<!--l. 134--><p class="noindent" >One evening Baagkar took Maruti to his Guru and that evening proved
to be the turning point in his life. The Guru gave him a mantra and
instructions in meditation. Early in his practice he started having
visions and occasionally even fell into trances. Something exploded
within him, as it were, giving birth to a cosmic consciousness, a sense

of eternal life. The identity of Maruti, the petty shopkeeper,
dissolved and the illuminating personality of Sri Nisargadatta
emerged.
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >Most people live in the world of self-consciousness and do not have the
desire or power to leave it.
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >They exist only for themselves; all their effort is directed towards
achievement of self-satisfaction and self-glorification. There are,
however, seers, teachers and revealers who, while apparently living in
the same world, live simultaneously in another world also &#8211; the world of
cosmic consciousness, effulgent with infinite knowledge. After
his illuminating experience Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj started
living such a dual life. He conducted his shop, but ceased to be
a profit-minded merchant. Later, abandoning his family and
business he became a mendicant, a pilgrim over the vastness and
variety of the Indian religious scene. He walked barefooted on
his way to the Himalayas where he planned to pass the rest
of his years in quest of a eternal life. But he soon retraced his
steps and came back home comprehending the futility of such a
quest. Eternal life, he perceived, was not to be sought for; he
already had it. Having gone beyond the I-am-the-body idea, he had
acquired a mental state so joyful, peaceful and glorious that
everything appeared to be worthless compared to it. He had attained
self-realisation.
<!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >Uneducated though the Master is, his conversation is enlightened to an
extraordinary degree.
<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >Though born and brought up in poverty, he is the richest of
the rich, for he has the limitless wealth of perennial knowledge,
compared to which the most fabulous treasures are mere tinsel. He is
warm-hearted and tender, shrewdly humorous, absolutely fearless and
absolutely true &#8211; inspiring, guiding and supporting all who come to

him.
<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >Any attempt to write a biographical not on such a man is frivolous and
futile. For he is not a man with a past or future; he is the living
present &#8211; eternal and immutable. He is the self that has become all
things.

<h2 class="likechapterHead"><a
 id="x1-4000"></a>Translators Note</h2>  <a
 id="Q1-1-7"></a>
<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >I met Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj some years back and was impressed
with the spontaneous simplicity of his appearance and behaviour and
his deep and genuine earnestness in expounding his experience.
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >However humble and difficult to discover his little tenement in the back
lanes of Bombay, many have found their way there. Most of them are
Indians, conversing freely in their native language, but there were also
many foreigners who needed a translator. Whenever I was present the
task would fall to me. Many of the questions put and answers given
were so interesting and significant that a tape-recorder was brought in.
While most of the tapes were of the regular Marathi-English variety,
some were polygot scrambles of several Indian and European
languages. Later, each tape was deciphered and translated into
English.
<!--l. 154--><p class="noindent" >It was not easy to translate verbatim and at the same time avoid
tedious repetitions and reiterations.
<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >It is hoped that the present translation of the tape-recordings will not
reduce the impact of this clear-minded, generous and in many ways an
unusual human being.

<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >A Marathi version of these talks, verified by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj
himself, has been separately published.

<h2 class="likechapterHead"><a
 id="x1-5000"></a>Editors Note</h2>  <a
 id="Q1-1-9"></a> The present edition of I AM THAT is a revised and
re-edited version of the 101 talks that appeared in two volumes in
earlier editions. Not only the matter has now been re-set in a more
readable typeface and with chapter headings, but new pictures of Sri
Nisargadatta Maharaj have been included and the appendices contain
some hitherto unpublished valuable material.
<!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >I draw special attention to the reader to the contribution entitled
&#8216;Nisarga Yoga&#8217;, in which my esteemed friend, the late Maurice
Frydman, has succinctly presented the teaching of Maharaj.
<!--l. 173--><p class="noindent" >Simplicity and humility are the keynotes of his teachings, as
Maurice observes. The Master does not propound any intellectual
concept or doctrine. He does not put forward any pre-conditions
before the seekers and is happy with them as they are. In fact Sri
Nisargadatta Maharaj is peculiarly free from all disparagement and
condemnation; the sinner and the saint are merely exchanging notes;
the saint has sinned, the sinner can be sanctified. It is time that
divides them; it is time that will bring them together. The teacher
does not evaluate; his sole concern is with &#8216;suffering and the
ending of suffering&#8217;. He knows from his personal and abiding
experience that the roots of sorrow are in the mind and it is the mind
that must be freed from its distorting and destructive habits. Of
these the identification of the self with its projections is most

fatal. By precept and example Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj shows a
short-cut, a-logical but empirically sound. It operates, when
understood.
<!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >Revising and editing of I AM THAT has been for me a pilgrimage to
my inner self &#8211; at once ennobling and enlightening. I have done my
work in a spirit of dedication, with great earnestness. I have treated the
questions of every questioner as mine own questions and have imbibed
the answers of the Master with a mind emptied of all it knew. However,
in this process of what may be called a two-voiced meditation, it is
possible that at places I may have failed in the cold-blooded
punctiliousness about the syntax and punctuation, expected
of an editor. For such lapses, if any, I seek forgiveness of the
reader.
<!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >Before closing, I wish to express my heart-felt thanks to Professor
Douwe Tiemersma of the Philosophical Faculty Erasmus, Universieit,
Rottendam, Holland for contributing a new Foreword to this edition.
That he acceeded to my request promptly makes me feel all the more
grateful.

<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>It is a matter of daily experience that on waking up the
world suddenly appears. Where does it come from?
<!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Before anything can come into being there must be
somebody to whom it comes. All appearance and disappearance
presupposes a change against some changeless background.
<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Before waking up I was unconscious.
<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In what sense? Having forgotten, or not having experienced? Don&#8217;t
you experience even when unconscious? Can you exist without
knowing? A lapse in memory: is it a proof of non-existence?
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >And can you validly talk about your own non-existence as an actual
experience? You cannot even say that your mind did not exist. Did you
not wake up on being called? And on waking up, was it not the sense &#8216;I
am&#8217; that came first? Some seed consciousness must be existing even
during sleep, or swoon. On waking up the experience runs: &#8216;I am &#8211; the
body &#8211; in the world.&#8217; It may appear to arise in succession but in fact it
is all simultaneous, a single idea of having a body in a world.
Can there be the sense of &#8216;I am&#8217; without being somebody or
other?
<!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am always somebody with its memories and habits. I know no
other &#8216;I am&#8217;.
<!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe something prevents you from knowing? When you do not
know something which others know, what do you do?
<!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I seek the source of their knowledge under their instruction.
<!--l. 206--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Is it not important to you to know whether you are a mere body, or

something else? Or, maybe nothing at all? Don&#8217;t you see that all your
problems are your body&#8217;s problems &#8211; food, clothing, shelter,
family, friends, name, fame, security, survival &#8211; all these lose their
meaning the moment you realise that you may not be a mere
body.
<!--l. 208--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What benefit is there in knowing that I am not the body?
<!--l. 210--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Even to say that you are not the body is not quite true. In a way
you are all the bodies, hearts and minds and much more. Go deep into
the sense of &#8216;I am&#8217; and you will find. How do you find a thing you
have mislaid or forgotten? You keep it in your mind until you
recall it. The sense of being, of &#8216;I am&#8217; is the first to emerge. Ask
yourself whence it comes, or just watch it quietly. When the
mind stays in the &#8216;I am&#8217; without moving, you enter a state which
cannot be verbalised but can be experienced. All you need to do is
try and try again. After all the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; is always with you,
only you have attached all kinds of things to it &#8211; body, feelings,
thoughts, ideas, possessions etc. All these self-identifications are
misleading. Because of them you take yourself to be what you are
not.
<!--l. 212--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then what am I?
<!--l. 214--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is enough to know what you are not. You need not know what
you are. For as long as knowledge means description in terms of what is
already known, perceptual, or conceptual, there can be no such thing as
self-knowledge, for what you are cannot be described, except as except
as total negation. All you can say is: &#8216;I am not this, I am not that&#8217;.
You cannot meaningfully say &#8216;this is what I am&#8217;. It just makes
no sense. What you can point out as &#8216;this&#8217; or &#8216;that&#8217; cannot be
yourself.
<!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >Surely, you can not be &#8216;something&#8217; else. You are nothing perceivable, or

imaginable. Yet, without you there can be neither perception nor
imagination. You observe the heart feeling, the mind thinking, the
body acting; the very act of perceiving shows that you are not
what you perceive. Can there be perception, experience without
you? An experience must &#8216;belong&#8217;. Somebody must come and
declare it as his own. Without an experiencer the experience is not
real. It is the experiencer that imparts reality to experience.
An experience which you cannot have, of what value is it to
you?
<!--l. 218--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The sense of being an experiencer, the sense of &#8216;I am&#8217;, is it not also
an experience?
<!--l. 220--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Obviously, every thing experienced is an experience. And in every
experience there arises the experiencer of it. Memory creates
the illusion of continuity. In reality each experience has its own
experiencer and the sense of identity is due to the common factor at
the root of all experiencer-experience relations. Identity and
continuity are not the same. Just as each flower has its own
colour, but all colours are caused by the same light, so do many
experiences appear in the undivided and indivisible awareness, each
separate in memory, identical in essence. This essence is the
root, the foundation, the timeless and spaceless &#8216;possibility&#8217; of all
experience.
<!--l. 222--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do I get at it?
<!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You need not get at it, for you are it. It will get at you,
if you give it a chance. Let go your attachment to the unreal
and the real will swiftly and smoothly step into its own. Stop
imagining yourself being or doing this or that and the realisation that
you are the source and heart of all will dawn upon you. With
this will come great love which is not choice or predilection, nor
attachment, but a power which makes all things love-worthy and

lovable.

<!--l. 228--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Maharaj, you are sitting in front of me and I am here at
your feet. What is the basic difference between us?
<!--l. 230--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>There is no basic difference.
<!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still there must be some real difference, I come to you, you do not
come to me.
<!--l. 234--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because you imagine differences, you go here and there in search of
&#8216;superior&#8217; people.
<!--l. 236--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You too are a superior person. You claim to know the real, while I
do not.
<!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Did I ever tell you that you do not know and, therefore, you are
inferior? Let those who invented such distinctions prove them. I do not
claim to know what you do not. In fact, I know much less than you
do.
<!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Your words are wise, your behaviour noble, your grace all-powerful.
<!--l. 242--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I know nothing about it all and see no difference between you and
me. My life is a succession of events, just like yours. Only I am
detached and see the passing show as a passing show, while you stick to
things and move along with them.
<!--l. 244--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What made you so dispassionate?
<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing in particular. It so happened that I trusted my Guru. He
told me I am nothing but my self and I believed him. Trusting him, I
behaved accordingly and ceased caring for what was not me, nor
mine.

<!--l. 248--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why were you lucky to trust your teacher fully, while our trust is
nominal and verbal?
<!--l. 250--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who can say? It happened so. Things happen without cause and
reason and, after all, what does it matter, who is who? Your high
opinion of me is your opinion only. Any moment you may change it.
Why attach importance to opinions, even your own?
<!--l. 252--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still, you are different. Your mind seems to be always quiet and
happy. And miracles happen round you.
<!--l. 254--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I know nothing about miracles, and I wonder whether nature
admits exceptions to her laws, unless we agree that everything is a
miracle. As to my mind, there is no such thing. There is consciousness
in which everything happens. It is quite obvious and within the
experience of everybody. You just do not look carefully enough. Look
well, and see what I see.
<!--l. 256--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What do you see?
<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I see what you too could see, here and now, but for the wrong focus
of your attention. You give no attention to your self. Your mind is all
with things, people and ideas, never with your self. Bring your self into
focus, become aware of your own existence. See how you function,
watch the motives and the results of your actions. Study the prison you
have built around yourself by inadvertence. By knowing what you are
not, you come to know your self. The way back to your self is through
refusal and rejection. One thing is certain: the real is not imaginary, it
is not a product of the mind. Even the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; is not continuous,
though it is a useful pointer; it shows where to seek, but not what
to seek. Just have a good look at it. Once you are convinced
that you cannot say truthfully about your self anything except
&#8216;I am&#8217;, and that nothing that can be pointed at, can be your
self, the need for the &#8216;I am&#8217; is over &#8211; you are no longer intent

on verbalising what you are. All you need is to get rid of the
tendency to define your self. All definitions apply to your body
only and to its expressions. Once this obsession with the body
goes, you will revert to your natural state, spontaneously and
effortlessly. The only difference between us is that I am aware of
my natural state, while you are bemused. Just like gold made
into ornaments has no advantage over gold dust, except when
the mind makes it so, so are we one in being &#8211; we differ only
in appearance. We discover it by being earnest, by searching,
enquiring, questioning daily and hourly, by giving one&#8217;s life to this
discovery.

 id="x1-80003"></a>The Living Present</h2>
<!--l. 263--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>As I can see, there is nothing wrong with my body nor
with my real being. Both are not of my making and need not be
improved upon. What has gone wrong is the &#8216;inner body&#8217;, call it mind,
consciousness, antahkarana, whatever the name.
<!--l. 265--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>What do you consider to be wrong with your mind?
<!--l. 267--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is restless, greedy of the pleasant and afraid of the unpleasant.
<!--l. 269--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is wrong with its seeking the pleasant and shirking the
unpleasant? Between the banks of pain and pleasure the river of life
flows. It is only when the mind refuses to flow with life, and gets stuck
at the banks, that it becomes a problem. By flowing with life I mean
acceptance &#8211; letting come what comes and go what goes. Desire not,
fear not, observe the actual, as and when it happens, for you are not
what happens, you are to whom it happens. Ultimately even the
observer you are not.
<!--l. 271--><p class="noindent" >You are the ultimate potentiality of which the all-embracing
consciousness is the manifestation and expression.
<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet, between the body and the self there lies a cloud of thoughts
and feelings, which neither server the body nor the self. These thoughts
and feelings are flimsy, transient and meaningless, mere mental
dust that blinds and chokes, yet they are there, obscuring and
destroying.
<!--l. 275--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Surely, the memory of an event cannot pass for the event itself. Nor
can the anticipation. There is something exceptional, unique, about the
present event, which the previous, or the coming do not have. There is
a livingness about it, an actuality; it stands out as if illuminated. There
is the &#8216;stamp of reality&#8217; on the actual, which the past and the future do

not have.
<!--l. 277--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What gives the present that &#8216;stamp of reality&#8217;?
<!--l. 279--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is nothing peculiar in the present event to make it
different from the past and future. For a moment the past was
actual and the future will become so. What makes the present so
different?
<!--l. 281--><p class="noindent" >Obviously, my presence. I am real for I am always now, in the present,
and what is with me now shares in my reality. The past is in memory,
the future &#8211; in imagination. There is nothing in the present event itself
that makes it stand out as real. It may be some simple, periodical
occurrence, like the striking of the clock. In spite of our knowing that
the successive strokes are identical, the present stroke is quite
different from the previous one and the next &#8211; as remembered, or
expected.
<!--l. 283--><p class="noindent" >A thing focussed in the now is with me, for I am ever present; it is my
own reality that I impart to the present event.
<!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But we deal with things remembered as if they were real.
<!--l. 287--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>We consider memories, only when they come into the present The
forgotten is not counted until one is reminded &#8211; which implies, bringing
into the now.
<!--l. 289--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, I can see there is in the now some unknown factor that gives
momentary reality to the transient actuality.
<!--l. 291--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You need not say it is unknown, for you see it in constant
operation. Since you were born, has it ever changed? Things and
thoughts have been changing all the time. But the feeling that what is
now is real has never changed, even in dream.

<!--l. 293--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In deep sleep there is no experience of the present reality.
<!--l. 295--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The blankness of deep sleep is due entirely to the lack of specific
memories. But a general memory of well-being is there. There is a
difference in feeling when we say &#8216;I was deeply asleep&#8217; from &#8216;I was

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We shall repeat the question we began with: between life&#8217;s
source and life&#8217;s expression (which is the body), there is the mind
and its ever-changeful states. The stream of mental states is
endless, meaningless and painful. Pain is the constant factor.
What we call pleasure is but a gap, an interval between two
painful states. Desire and fear are the weft and warp of living, and
both are made of pain. Our question is: can there be a happy
mind?
<!--l. 299--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Desire is the memory of pleasure and fear is the memory of pain.
Both make the mind restless.
<!--l. 301--><p class="noindent" >Moments of pleasure are merely gaps in the stream of pain. How can
the mind be happy?
<!--l. 303--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>That is true when we desire pleasure or expect pain. But there are
moments of unexpected, unanticipated joy. Pure joy, uncontaminated
by desire &#8211; unsought, undeserved, God-given.
<!--l. 305--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Still, joy is joy only against a background of pain.
<!--l. 307--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is pain a cosmic fact, or purely mental?
<!--l. 309--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The universe is complete and where there is completeness, where
nothing lacks, what can give pain?
<!--l. 311--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The Universe may be complete as a whole, but incomplete in

details.
<!--l. 313--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A part of the whole seen in relation to the whole is also complete.
Only when seen in isolation it becomes deficient and thus a seat of
pain. What makes for isolation?
<!--l. 315--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Limitations of the mind, of course. The mind cannot see the whole
for the part.
<!--l. 317--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Good enough. The mind, by its very nature, divides and opposes.
Can there be some other mind, which unites and harmonises, which
sees the whole in the part and the part as totally related to the
whole?
<!--l. 319--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The other mind &#8211; where to look for it?
<!--l. 321--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In the going beyond the limiting, dividing and opposing mind. In
ending the mental process as we know it. When this comes to an end,
that mind is born.
<!--l. 323--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In that mind, the problem of joy and sorrow exist no longer?
<!--l. 325--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not as we know them, as desirable or repugnant. It becomes rather
a question of love seeking expression and meeting with obstacles. The
inclusive mind is love in action, battling against circumstances, initially
frustrated, ultimately victorious.
<!--l. 327--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Between the spirit and the body, is it love that provides the
bridge?
<!--l. 329--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else? Mind creates the abyss, the heart crosses it.

<!--l. 333--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>On several occasions the question was raised as to
whether the universe is subject to the law of causation, or does it exist
and function outside the law. You seem to hold the view that it is
uncaused, that everything, however small, is uncaused, arising and
disappearing for no known reason whatsoever.
<!--l. 335--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Causation means succession in time of events in space, the
space being physical or mental. Time, space, causation are mental
categories, arising and subsiding with the mind.
<!--l. 337--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As long as the mind operates, causation is a valid law.
<!--l. 339--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Like everything mental, the so-called law of causation contradicts
itself. No thing in existence has a particular cause; the entire universe
contributes to the existence of even the smallest thing; nothing could
be as it is without the universe being what it is. When the source and
ground of everything is the only cause of everything, to speak of
causality as a universal law is wrong. The universe is not bound by its
content, because its potentialities are infinite; besides it is a
manifestation, or expression of a principle fundamentally and totally
free.
<!--l. 341--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, one can see that ultimately to speak of one thing being the
only cause of another thing is altogether wrong. Yet, in actual life we
invariably initiate action with a view to a result.
<!--l. 343--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, there is a lot of such activity going on, because of ignorance.
&#8216;Would people know that nothing can happen unless the entire universe
makes it happen, they would achieve much more with less expenditure
of energy.
<!--l. 345--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If everything is an expression of the totality of causes, how can we

talk of a purposeful action towards an achievement?
<!--l. 347--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The very urge to achieve is also an expression of the total universe.
It merely shows that the energy potential has risen at a particular
point. It is the illusion of time that makes you talk of causality. When
the past and the future are seen in the timeless now, as parts of a
common pattern, the idea of cause-effect loses its validity and creative
freedom takes its place.
<!--l. 349--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet, I cannot see how can anything come to be without a
cause.
<!--l. 351--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When I say a thing is without a cause, I mean it can be with-out a
particular cause. Your own mother was needed to give you birth; But
you could not have been born without the sun and the earth. Even
these could not have caused your birth without your own desire to be
born. It is desire that gives birth, that gives name and form. The
desirable is imagined and wanted and manifests itself as something
tangible or con-ceivable. Thus is created the world in which we live, our
personal world. The real world is beyond the mind&#8217;s ken; we see it
through the net of our desires, divided into pleasure and pain, right and
wrong, inner and outer. To see the universe as it is, you must step
beyond the net. It is not hard to do so, for the net is full of
holes.
<!--l. 353--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What do you mean by holes? And how to find them?
<!--l. 355--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Look at the net and its many contradictions. You do and undo at
every step. You want peace, love, happiness and work hard to
create pain, hatred and war. You want longevity and overeat,
you want friendship and exploit. See your net as made of such
contradictions and remove them &#8211; your very seeing them will make
them go.

<!--l. 357--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Since my seeing the contradiction makes it go, is there no causal
link between my seeing and its going?
<!--l. 359--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Causality, even as a concept, does not apply to chaos.
<!--l. 361--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To what extent is desire a causal factor?
<!--l. 363--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>One of the many. For everything there are innumerable causal
factors. But the source of all that is, is the Infinite Possibility, the
Supreme Reality, which is in you and which throws its power and light
and love on every experience. But, this source is not a cause and no
cause is a source.
<!--l. 365--><p class="noindent" >Because of that, I say everything is uncaused. You may try to trace
how a thing happens, but you cannot find out why a thing is as it is. A
thing is as it is, because the universe is as it is.

<!--l. 369--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Is the witness-consciousness permanent or not?
<!--l. 371--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>It is not permanent. The knower rises and sets with the
known. That in which both the knower and the known arise and
set, is beyond time. The words permanent or eternal do not
apply.
<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In sleep there is neither the known, nor the knower. What keeps the
body sensitive and receptive?
<!--l. 375--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Surely you cannot say the knower was absent. The experience of
things and thoughts was not there, that is all. But the absence
of experience too is experience. It is like entering a dark room
and saying: &#8216;I see nothing&#8217;. A man blind from birth knows not
what darkness means. Similarly, only the knower knows that he
does not know. Sleep is merely a lapse in memory. Life goes
on.
<!--l. 377--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what is death?
<!--l. 379--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is the change in the living process of a particular body.
Integration ends and disintegration sets in.
<!--l. 381--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But what about the knower. With the disappearance of the body,
does the knower disappear?
<!--l. 383--><p class="noindent" ><span

at death.
<!--l. 385--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And nothing remains?
<!--l. 387--><p class="noindent" ><span

its manifestation. When life produces another body, another knower
comes into being,
<!--l. 389--><p class="noindent" ><span

body-minds?
<!--l. 391--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, there is something that may be called the memory body, or
causal body, a record of all that was thought, wanted and done. It is
like a cloud of images held together
<!--l. 393--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is this sense of a separate existence?
<!--l. 395--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is a reflection in a separate body of the one reality. In
this reflection the unlimited and the limited are confused and
taken to be the same. To undo this confusion is the purpose of
Yoga.
<!--l. 397--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does not death undo this confusion?
<!--l. 399--><p class="noindent" ><span

does not, reality does not. And the life is never so alive as after
death.

sense of &#8216;I&#8217;.
<!--l. 405--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to go about this finding out?
<!--l. 407--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How do you go about finding anything? By keeping your mind and
heart in it. Interest there must be and steady remembrance. To
remember what needs to be remembered is the secret of success.

<!--l. 409--><p class="noindent" >You come to it through earnestness.
<!--l. 411--><p class="noindent" ><span

Surely, both qualifications and opportunities are needed.
<!--l. 413--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>These will come with earnestness. What is supremely important is
to be free from contradictions: the goal and the way must not be
on different levels; life and light must not quarrel; behaviour
must not betray belief. Call it honesty, integrity, wholeness; you
must not go back, undo, uproot, abandon the conquered ground.
Tenacity of purpose and honesty in pursuit will bring you to your
goal.

 id="x1-110006"></a>Meditation</h2>
<!--l. 421--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>All teachers advise to meditate. What is the purpose of
meditation?
<!--l. 423--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>We know the outer world of sensations and actions, but of
our inner world of thoughts and feelings we know very little. The
primary purpose of meditation is to become conscious of, and familiar
with, our inner life. The ultimate purpose is to reach the source of life
and consciousness.
<!--l. 425--><p class="noindent" >Incidentally practice of meditation affects deeply our character. We are
slaves to what we do not know; of what we know we are masters.
Whatever vice or weakness in ourselves we discover and understand its
causes and its workings, we over-come it by the very knowing; the
unconscious dissolves when brought into the conscious. The dissolution
of the unconscious releases energy; the mind feels adequate and become
quiet.
<!--l. 427--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the use of a quiet mind?
<!--l. 429--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When the mind is quiet, we come to know ourselves as the pure
witness. We withdraw from the experience and its experiencer and
stand apart in pure awareness, which is between and beyond the two.
The personality, based on self-identification, on imagining oneself to
be something: &#8216;I am this, I am that&#8217;, continues, but only as a
part of the objective world. Its identification with the witness
snaps.
<!--l. 431--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As I can make out, I live on many levels and life on each level
requires energy. The self by its very nature delights in everything and
its energies flow outwards. Is it not the purpose of meditation to dam
up the energies on the higher levels, or to push them back and up, so as
to enable the higher levels to prosper also?

<!--l. 433--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not so much the matter of levels as of gunas (qualities).
Meditation is a sattvic activity and aims at complete elimination of
tamas (inertia) and rajas (motivity). Pure sattva (harmony) is perfect
freedom from sloth and restlessness.
<!--l. 435--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How to strengthen and purify the sattva?
<!--l. 437--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The sattva is pure and strong always. It is like the sun. It may
seem obscured by clouds and dust, but only from the point of view of
the perceiver. Deal with the causes of obscuration, not with the
sun.
<!--l. 439--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the use of sattva?
<!--l. 441--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is the use of truth, goodness, harmony, beauty? They are
their own goal. They manifest spontaneously and effortlessly, when
things are left to themselves, are not interfered with, not shunned, or
wanted, or conceptualised, but just experienced in full awareness, such
awareness itself is sattva. It does not make use of things and people &#8211; it
fulfils them.
<!--l. 443--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Since I cannot improve sattva, am I to deal with tamas and rajas
only? How can I deal with them?
<!--l. 445--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By watching their influence in you and on you. Be aware of
them in operation, watch their expressions in your thoughts,
words and deeds, and gradually their grip on you will lessen
and the clear light of sattva will emerge. It is neither difficult,
nor a protracted process; earnestness is the only condition of
success.

 id="x1-120007"></a>The Mind</h2>
<!--l. 449--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>There are very interesting books written by apparently
very competent people, in which the illusoriness of the world is denied
(though not its transitoriness). According to them, there exists a
hierarchy of beings, from the lowest to the highest; on each level the
complexity of the organism enables and reflects the depth, breadth and
intensity of consciousness, without any visible or knowable culmination.
One law supreme rules throughout: evolution of forms for the growth
and enrichment of consciousness and manifestation of its infinite
potentialities.
<!--l. 451--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>This may or may not be so. Even if it is, it is only so
from the mind&#8217;s point of view, but In fact the entire universe (
mahadakash) exists only in consciousness ( chidakash), while I
have my stand in the Absolute ( paramakash). In pure being
consciousness arises; in consciousness the world appears and
disappears. All there is is me, all there is is mine. Before all
beginnings, after all endings &#8211; I am. All has its being in me, in
the &#8216;I am&#8217;, that shines in every living being. Even not-being is
unthinkable without me. Whatever happens, I must be there to witness
it.
<!--l. 453--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why do you deny being to the world?
<!--l. 455--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I do not negate the world. I see it as appearing in consciousness,
which is the totality of the known in the immensity of the unknown.
<!--l. 457--><p class="noindent" >What begins and ends is mere appearance. The world can be said to
appear, but not to be. The appearance may last very long on some
scale of time, and be very short on another, but ultimately it comes to
the same. Whatever is time bound is momentary and has no
reality.

<!--l. 459--><p class="noindent" ><span

behave quite normally!
<!--l. 461--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That is how it appears to you. What in your case occupies the
entire field of consciousness, is a mere speck in mine. The world lasts,
but for a moment. It is your memory that makes you think that the
world continues. Myself, I don&#8217;t live by memory. I see the world as it is,
a momentary appearance in consciousness.

<!--l. 473--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 477--><p class="noindent" ><span

uncomposed, unshakable, unquestionable, unreachable by effort. Every
positive definition is from memory and, therefore, inapplicable. And yet
my state is supremely actual and, therefore, possible, realisable,
attainable.

<!--l. 481--><p class="noindent" ><span

your body and your world are there. Your world is mind-made,

subjective, enclosed within the mind, fragmentary, temporary, personal,

Your world is personal, private, unshareable, intimately your own.
Nobody can enter it, see as you see, hear as you hear, feel your
emotions and think your thoughts. In your world you are truly alone,
enclosed in your ever-changing dream, which you take for life. My
world is an open world, common to all, accessible to all. In my world
there is community, insight, love, real quality; the individual is the
total, the totality &#8211; in the individual. All are one and the One is

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can an unsteady mind make itself steady? Of course it cannot.
It is the nature of the mind to roam about. All you can do is to shift
the focus of consciousness beyond the mind.
<!--l. 529--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is it done?
<!--l. 531--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Refuse all thoughts except one: the thought &#8216;I am&#8217;. The mind will
rebel in the beginning, but with patience and perseverance it will yield
and keep quiet. Once you are quiet, things will begin to happen
spontaneously and quite naturally without any interference on your
part.
<!--l. 533--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can I avoid this protracted battle with my mind?
<!--l. 535--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, you can. Just live your life as it comes, but alertly,
watchfully, allowing everything to happen as it happens, doing
the natural things the natural way, suffering, rejoicing &#8211; as life
brings.
<!--l. 537--><p class="noindent" >This also is a way.

<!--l. 539--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Well, then I can as well marry, have children, run a business&#x2026; be
happy.
<!--l. 541--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Sure. You may or may not be happy, take it in your stride.
<!--l. 543--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet I want happiness.
<!--l. 545--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>True happiness cannot be found in things that change and pass
away. Pleasure and pain alternate inexorably. Happiness comes from
the self and can be found in the self only. Find your real self ( swarupa)
and all else will come with it.
<!--l. 547--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If my real self is peace and love, why is it so restless?
<!--l. 549--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not your real being that is restless, but its reflection in the
mind appears restless because the mind is restless. It is just like the
reflection of the moon in the water stirred by the wind. The wind
of desire stirs the mind and the &#8216;me&#8217;, which is but a reflection
of the Self in the mind, appears changeful. But these ideas of
movement, of restlessness, of pleasure and pain are all in the
mind.
<!--l. 551--><p class="noindent" >The Self stands beyond the mind, aware, but unconcerned.
<!--l. 553--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How to reach it?
<!--l. 555--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are the Self, here and now Leave the mind alone, stand aware
and unconcerned and you will realise that to stand alert but
detached, watching events come and go, is an aspect of your real
nature.
<!--l. 557--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What are the other aspects?
<!--l. 559--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The aspects are infinite in number. Realise one, and you will realise

all.
<!--l. 561--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Tell me some thing that would help me.
<!--l. 563--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You know best what you need!
<!--l. 565--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am restless. How can I gain peace?
<!--l. 567--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>For what do you need peace?
<!--l. 569--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To be happy.
<!--l. 571--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Are you not happy now?
<!--l. 573--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No, I am not.
<!--l. 575--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What makes you unhappy?
<!--l. 577--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have what I don&#8217;t want, and want what I don&#8217;t have.
<!--l. 579--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why don&#8217;t you invert it: want what you have and care not for what
you don&#8217;t have?
<!--l. 581--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I want what is pleasant and don&#8217;t want what is painful.
<!--l. 583--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How do you know what is pleasant and what is not?
<!--l. 585--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>From past experience, of course.
<!--l. 587--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Guided by memory you have been pursuing the pleasant and
shunning the unpleasant. Have you succeeded?
<!--l. 589--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No, I have not. The pleasant does not last. Pain sets in again.

<!--l. 591--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Which pain?
<!--l. 593--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The desire for pleasure, the fear of pain, both are states of distress.
Is there a state of unalloyed pleasure?
<!--l. 595--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Every pleasure, physical or mental, needs an instrument.
Both the physical and mental instruments are material, they get
tired and worn out. The pleasure they yield is necessarily limited
in intensity and duration. Pain is the background of all your
pleasures. You want them because you suffer. On the other hand,
the very search for pleasure is the cause of pain. It is a vicious
circle.
<!--l. 597--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can see the mechanism of my confusion, but I do not see my way
out of it.
<!--l. 599--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The very examination of the mechanism shows the way. After all,
your confusion is only in your mind, which never rebelled so far against
confusion and never got to grips with it. It rebelled only against
pain.
<!--l. 601--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So, all I can do is to stay confused?
<!--l. 603--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Be alert. Question, observe, investigate, learn all you can about
confusion, how it operates, what it does to you and others. By being
clear about confusion you become clear of confusion.
<!--l. 605--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I look into myself, I find my strongest desire is to create a
monument, to build something which will outlast me. Even when I
think of a home, wife and child, it is because it is a lasting, solid,
testimony to myself.
<!--l. 607--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Right, build yourself a monument. How do you propose to do
it?

<!--l. 609--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It matters little what I build, as long as it is permanent.
<!--l. 611--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Surely, you can see for yourself that nothing is permanent. All
wears out, breaks down, dissolves. The very ground on which you build
gives way. What can you build that will outlast all?
<!--l. 613--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Intellectually, verbally, I am aware that all is transient. Yet,
somehow my heart wants permanency. I want to create something that
lasts.
<!--l. 615--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Then you must build it of something lasting. What have you that is
lasting? Neither your body nor mind will last. You must look
elsewhere.
<!--l. 617--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I long for permanency, but I find it nowhere.
<!--l. 619--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Are you, yourself, not permanent?
<!--l. 621--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I was born, I shall die.
<!--l. 623--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Can you truly say you were not before you were born and can you
possibly say when dead:
<!--l. 625--><p class="noindent" >&#8216;Now I am no more&#8217;? You cannot say from your own experience that
you are not. You can only say
<!--l. 627--><p class="noindent" >&#8216;I am&#8217;. Others too cannot tell you &#8216;you are not&#8217;.
<!--l. 629--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is no &#8216;I am&#8217; in sleep.
<!--l. 631--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Before you make such sweeping statements, examine carefully your
waking state. You will soon discover that it is full of gaps, when the
min blanks out. Notice how little you remember even when fully awake.
You just don&#8217;t remember. A gap in memory is not necessarily a gap in

consciousness.
<!--l. 633--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can I make myself remember my state of deep sleep?
<!--l. 635--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course! By eliminating the intervals of inadvertence during your
waking hours you will gradually eliminate the long interval of
absent-mindedness, which you call sleep. You will be aware that you
are asleep.
<!--l. 637--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet, the problem of permanency, of continuity of being, is not
solved.
<!--l. 639--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Permanency is a mere idea, born of the action of time. Time again
depends of memory. By permanency you mean unfailing memory
through endless time. You want to eternalise the mind, which is not
possible.
<!--l. 641--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then what is eternal?
<!--l. 643--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That which does not change with time. You cannot eternalise a
transient thing &#8211; only the changeless is eternal.
<!--l. 645--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am familiar with the general sense of what you say. I do not crave
for more knowledge. All I want is peace.
<!--l. 647--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can have for the asking all the peace you want.
<!--l. 649--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am asking.
<!--l. 651--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You must ask with an undivided heart and live an integrated
life.
<!--l. 653--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How?

<!--l. 655--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Detach yourself from all that makes your mind restless. Renounce
all that disturbs its peace. If you want peace, deserve it.
<!--l. 657--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely everybody deserves peace.
<!--l. 659--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Those only deserve it, who don&#8217;t disturb it.
<!--l. 661--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In what way do I disturb peace?
<!--l. 663--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By being a slave to your desires and fears.
<!--l. 665--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even when they are justified?
<!--l. 667--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Emotional reactions, born of ignorance or inadvertence, are
never justified. Seek a clear mind and a clean heart. All you
need is to keep quietly alert, enquiring into the real nature of
yourself.
<!--l. 669--><p class="noindent" >This is the only way to peace.

always existed and is for ever undergoing transformation. Some say it is
subject to eternal laws. Others deny even causality.
<!--l. 675--><p class="noindent" >Some say the world is real. Others &#8211; that it has no being whatsoever.

<!--l. 679--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 681--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world you can perceive is a very small world indeed. And
it is entirely private. Take it to be a dream and be done with
it.
<!--l. 683--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I take it to be a dream? A dream does not last.
<!--l. 685--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How long will your own world last?
<!--l. 687--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>After all, my little world is but a part of the total.
<!--l. 689--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Is not the idea of a total world a part of your personal world? The
universe does not come to tell you that you are a part of it. It is you
who have invented a totality to contain you as a part. In fact all you
know is your own private world, however well you have furnished it
with your imaginations and expectations.
<!--l. 691--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, perception is not imagination!
<!--l. 693--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else? Perception is recognition, is it not? Something entirely
unfamiliar can be sensed, but cannot be perceived. Perception involves
memory.

<!--l. 695--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Granted, but memory does not make it illusion.
<!--l. 697--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Perception, imagination, expectation, anticipation, illusion
&#8211; all are based on memory. There are hardly any border lines
between them. They just merge into each other. All are responses of
memory.
<!--l. 699--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still, memory is there to prove the reality of my world.
<!--l. 701--><p class="noindent" ><span

what you were thinking, saying and doing on the 30th of the last

<!--l. 703--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, there is a blank.
<!--l. 705--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not so bad. You do remember a lot &#8211; unconscious memory
makes the world in which you live so familiar.
<!--l. 707--><p class="noindent" ><span

What about you? In what kind of world do you live?
<!--l. 709--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>My world is just like yours. I see, I hear, I feel, I think, I speak and
act in a world I perceive, just like you. But with you it is all, with me it
is nothing. Knowing the world to be a part of myself, I pay it no more
attention than you pay to the food you have eaten. While being
prepared and eaten, the food is separate from you and your
mind is on it; once swallowed, you become totally unconscious
of it. I have eaten up the world and I need not think of it any
more.
<!--l. 711--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Don&#8217;t you become completely irresponsible?
<!--l. 713--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How could I? How can I hurt something which is one with
me. On the contrary, without thinking of the world, whatever

I do will be of benefit to it. Just as the body sets itself right
unconsciously, so am I ceaselessly active in setting the world
right.
<!--l. 715--><p class="noindent" ><span

world?
<!--l. 717--><p class="noindent" ><span

the cruel strife between the citizen and the state.
<!--l. 725--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All these sufferings are man-made and it is within man&#8217;s power to
put an end to them. God helps by facing man with the results of his
actions and demanding that the balance should be restored. Karma is
the law that works for righteousness; it is the healing hand of
God.

<!--l. 743--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When your desire is not clear nor strong, it cannot take shape.
Besides, if your desires are personal, for your own enjoyment, the

others. Most of their experiences are valid for you too. Think clearly

emotional make-up and powerfully affect your actions. Remember, you
cannot abandon what you do not know. To go beyond yourself, you
must know yourself.

nothing.

<!--l. 821--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>I am aware of being asleep.
<!--l. 823--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not sleep a state of unconsciousness?
<!--l. 825--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 827--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And when awake, or dreaming?
<!--l. 829--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am aware of being awake or dreaming.
<!--l. 831--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do not catch you. What exactly do you mean? Let me make my
terms clear: by being asleep I mean unconscious, by being awake I
mean conscious, by dreaming I mean conscious of one&#8217;s mind, but not
of the surroundings.
<!--l. 833--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Well, it is about the same with me, Yet, there seems to be a
difference. In each state you forget the other two, while to me, there is
but one state of being, including and transcending the three mental
states of waking, dreaming and sleeping.
<!--l. 835--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you see in the world a direction and a purpose?
<!--l. 837--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world is but a reflection of my imagination. Whatever I want
to see, I can see. But why should I invent patterns of creation,
evolution and destruction? I do not need them and have no desire to
lock up the world in a mental picture.
<!--l. 839--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Coming back to sleep. Do you dream?
<!--l. 841--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course.

<!--l. 843--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What are your dreams?
<!--l. 845--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Echoes of the waking state.
<!--l. 847--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And your deep sleep?
<!--l. 849--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The brain consciousness is suspended.
<!--l. 851--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you then unconscious?
<!--l. 853--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Unconscious of my surroundings &#8211; yes.
<!--l. 855--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Not quite unconscious?
<!--l. 857--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I remain aware that I am unconscious.
<!--l. 859--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You use the words &#8216;aware&#8217; and &#8216;conscious&#8217;. Are they not the
same?
<!--l. 861--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Awareness is primordial; it is the original state, beginningless,
endless, uncaused, unsupported, without parts, without change.
Consciousness is on contact, a reflection against a surface, a state of
duality. There can be no consciousness without awareness, but there
can be awareness without consciousness, as in deep sleep. Awareness is
absolute, consciousness is relative to its content; consciousness is always
of something. Consciousness is partial and changeful, awareness is total,
changeless, calm and silent. And it is the common matrix of every
experience.
<!--l. 863--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one go beyond consciousness into awareness?
<!--l. 865--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Since it is awareness that makes consciousness possible, there is
awareness in every state of consciousness. Therefore the very
consciousness of being conscious is already a movement in awareness.

Interest in your stream of consciousness takes you to awareness. It is
not a new state.
<!--l. 867--><p class="noindent" >It is at once recognised as the original, basic existence, which is life
itself, and also love and joy.
<!--l. 869--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Since reality is all the time with us, what does self-realisation
consist of?
<!--l. 871--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Realisation is but the opposite of ignorance. To take the world as
real and one&#8217;s self as unreal is ignorance. The cause of sorrow. To know
the self as the only reality and all else as temporal and transient is
freedom, peace and joy. It is all very simple. Instead of seeing things as
imagined, learn to see them as they are. It is like cleansing a mirror.
The same mirror that shows you the world as it is, will also show you
your own face. The thought &#8216;I am&#8217; is the polishing cloth. Use
it.

<!--l. 875--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Kindly tell us how you realised.
<!--l. 877--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>I met my Guru when I was 34 and realised by 37.
<!--l. 879--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What happened? What was the change?
<!--l. 881--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pleasure and pain lost their sway over me. I was free from
desire and fear. I found myself full, needing nothing. I saw that
in the ocean of pure awareness, on the surface of the universal
consciousness, the numberless waves of the phenomenal worlds arise
and subside beginninglessly and endlessly. As consciousness, they are
all me. As events they are all mine. There is a mysterious power
that looks after them. That power is awareness, Self, Life, God,
whatever name you give it. It is the foundation, the ultimate support
of all that is, just like gold is the basis for all gold jewellery.
And it is so intimately ours! Abstract the name and shape from
the jewellery and the gold becomes obvious. Be free of name
and form and of the desires and fears they create, then what
remains?
<!--l. 883--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Nothingness.
<!--l. 885--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, the void remains. But the void is full to the brim. It is the
eternal potential as consciousness is the eternal actual.
<!--l. 887--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By potential you mean the future?
<!--l. 889--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Past, present and future &#8211; they are all there. And infinitely
more.
<!--l. 891--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But since the void is void, it is of little use to us.

<!--l. 893--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can you say so? Without breach in continuity how can there
be rebirth? Can there be renewal without death? Even the darkness of
sleep is refreshing and rejuvenating. Without death we would have been
bogged up for ever in eternal senility.
<!--l. 895--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no such thing as immortality?
<!--l. 897--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When life and death are seen as essential to each other, as
two aspects of one being, that is immortality. To see the end
in the beginning and beginning in the end is the intimation of
eternity.
<!--l. 899--><p class="noindent" >Definitely, immortality is not continuity. Only the process of change
continues. Nothing lasts.
<!--l. 901--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Awareness lasts?
<!--l. 903--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Awareness is not of time. Time exists in consciousness only. Beyond
consciousness where are time and space?
<!--l. 905--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Within the field of your consciousness there is your body
also.
<!--l. 907--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. But the idea &#8216;my body&#8217;, as different from other bodies, is
not there. To me it is &#8216;a body&#8217;, not &#8216;my body&#8217;, &#8216;a mind&#8217;, not &#8216;my mind&#8217;.
The mind looks after the body all right, I need not interfere.
What needs be done is being done, in the normal and natural
way.
<!--l. 909--><p class="noindent" >You may not be quite conscious of your physiological functions, but
when it comes to thoughts and feelings, desires and fears you become
acutely self-conscious. To me these too are largely unconscious. I find
myself talking to people, or doing things quite correctly and
appropriately, without being very much conscious of them. It looks as if

I live my physical, waking life automatically, reacting spontaneously
and accurately.
<!--l. 911--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does this spontaneous response come as a result of realisation, or by
training?
<!--l. 913--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Both. Devotion to you goal makes you live a clean and orderly life,
given to search for truth and to helping people, and realisation makes
noble virtue easy and spontaneous, by removing for good the obstacles
in the shape of desires and fears and wrong ideas.
<!--l. 915--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Don&#8217;t you have desires and fears any more?
<!--l. 917--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>My destiny was to be born a simple man, a commoner, a humble
tradesman, with little of formal education. My life was the common
kind, with common desires and fears. When, through my faith in my
teacher and obedience to his words, I realised my true being, I left
behind my human nature to look after itself, until its destiny is
exhausted. Occasionally an old reaction, emotional or mental, happens
in the mind, but it is at once noticed and discarded. After all, as long
as one is bur-dened with a person, one is exposed to its idiosyncrasies
and habits.
<!--l. 919--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you not afraid of death?
<!--l. 921--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am dead already.
<!--l. 923--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In what sense?
<!--l. 925--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am double dead. Not only am I dead to my body, but to my mind
too.
<!--l. 927--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Well, you do not look dead at all!

<!--l. 929--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That&#8217;s what you say! You seem to know my state better than I
do!
<!--l. 931--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sorry. But I just do not understand. You say you are bodyless and
mindless, while I see you very much alive and articulate.
<!--l. 933--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A tremendously complex work is going on all the time in your
brain and body, are you conscious of it? Not at all. Yet for an
outsider all seems to be going on intelligently and purposefully.
Why not admit that one&#8217;s entire personal life may sink largely
below the threshold of consciousness and yet proceed sanely and
smoothly?
<!--l. 935--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it normal?
<!--l. 937--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is normal? Is your life &#8211; obsessed by desires and fears, full of
strife and struggle, meaningless and joyless &#8211; normal? To be acutely
conscious of your body id it normal? To be torn by feelings, tortured by
thoughts: is it normal? A healthy body, a healthy mind live largely
unperceived by their owner; only occasionally, through pain or suffering
they call for attention and insight. Why not extend the same to
the entire personal life? One can function rightly, responding
well and fully to whatever happens, without having to bring it
into the focus of awareness. When self-control becomes second
nature, awareness shifts its focus to deeper levels of existence and
action.
<!--l. 939--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Don&#8217;t you become a robot?
<!--l. 941--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What harm is there in making automatic, what is habitual and
repetitive? It is automatic anyhow.
<!--l. 943--><p class="noindent" >But when it is also chaotic, it causes pain and suffering and calls for
attention. The entire purpose of a clean and well-ordered life is

to liberate man from the thraldom of chaos and the burden of
sorrow.
<!--l. 945--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You seem to be in favour of a computerised life.
<!--l. 947--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is wrong with a life which is free from problems? Personality
is merely a reflection of the real. Why should not the reflection be true
to the original as a matter of course, automatically? Need the person
have any designs of its own? The life of which it is an expression will
guide it. Once you realise that the person is merely a shadow of the
reality, but not reality itself, you cease to fret and worry. You agree
to be guided from within and life becomes a journey into the
unknown.

<!--l. 951--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>From what you told us it appears that you are not quite
conscious of your surroundings. To us you seem extremely alert and
active. We cannot possibly believe that you are in a kind of hypnotic
state, which leaves no memory behind. On the contrary, your memory
seems excellent. How are we to understand your statement that
the world and all it includes does not exist, as far as you are
concerned.
<!--l. 953--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>It is all a matter of focus. Your mind is focussed in the
world, mine is focussed in reality. It is like the moon in daylight &#8211; when
the sun shines, the moon is hardly visible. Or, watch how you take
your food. As long as it is in your mouth, you are conscious
of it; once swallowed, it does not concern you any longer. It
would be troublesome to have it constantly in mind until it is
eliminated.
<!--l. 955--><p class="noindent" >The mind should be normally in abeyance &#8211; incessant activity is a
morbid state. The universe works by itself &#8211; that I know. What else do
I need to know?
<!--l. 957--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So a jnani knows what he is doing only when he turns his mind to
it; otherwise he just acts, without being concerned.
<!--l. 959--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The average man is not conscious of his body as such. He is
conscious of his sensations, feelings and thoughts. Even these, once
detachment sets in, move away from the centre of consciousness and
happen spontaneously and effortlessly.
<!--l. 961--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What then is in the centre of consciousness?
<!--l. 963--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That which cannot be given name and form, for it is without
quality and beyond consciousness.

<!--l. 965--><p class="noindent" >You may say it is a point in consciousness, which is beyond consciousness.
Like a hole in the paper is both in the paper and yet not of paper, so is
the supreme state in the very centre of consciousness, and yet beyond
consciousness. It is as if an opening in the mind through which the
mind is flooded with light. The opening is not even the light. It is just
an opening.
<!--l. 967--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>An opening is just void, absence.
<!--l. 969--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite so. From the mind&#8217;s point of view, it is but an opening for
the light of awareness to enter the mental space. By itself the light can
only be compared to a solid, dense, rocklike, homogeneous and
changeless mass of pure awareness, free from the mental patterns of
name and shape.
<!--l. 971--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there any connection between the mental space and the supreme
abode?
<!--l. 973--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The supreme gives existence to the mind. The mind gives existence
to the body.
<!--l. 975--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what lies beyond?
<!--l. 977--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Take an example. A venerable Yogi, a master in the art of
longevity, himself over 1000 years old, comes to teach me his art. I
fully respect and sincerely admire his achievements, yet all I can
tell him is: of what use is longevity to me? I am beyond time.
However long a life may be, it is but a moment and a dream.
In the same way I am beyond all attributes. They appear and
disappear in my light, but cannot describe me. The universe is all
names and forms, based on qualities and their differences, while I
am beyond. The world is there because I am, but I am not the
world.

<!--l. 979--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But you are living in the world!
<!--l. 981--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That&#8217;s what you say! I know there is a world, which includes this
body and this mind, but I do not consider them to be more &#8220;mine&#8221;
than other minds and bodies. They are there, in time and space, but I
am timeless and spaceless.
<!--l. 983--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But since all exists by your light, are you not the creator of the
world?
<!--l. 985--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am neither the potentiality nor the actualisation, nor the
actuality of things. In my light they come and go as the specks of dust
dancing in the sunbeam. The light illumines the specks, but does not
depend on them. Nor can it be said to create them. It cannot be even
said to know them.
<!--l. 987--><p class="noindent" ><span

conscious of the question and the answer?
<!--l. 989--><p class="noindent" ><span

events the question happens and the answer happens. Nothing happens
to me. Everything just happens.
<!--l. 991--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And you are the witness?
<!--l. 993--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What does witness mean? Mere knowledge. It rained and now the
rain is over. I did not get wet.

rain.
<!--l. 997--><p class="noindent" ><span

appears to eat, drink and so on. Is he aware of it, or not?

<!--l. 999--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That in which consciousness happens, the universal consciousness
or mind, we call the ether of consciousness. All the objects of
consciousness form the universe. What is beyond both, supporting
both, is the supreme state, a state of utter stillness and silence.
Whoever goes there, disappears. It is unreachable by words,
or mind. You may call it God, or Parabrahman, or Supreme
Reality, but these are names given by the mind. It is the nameless,
contentless, effortless and spontaneous state, beyond being and not
being.
<!--l. 1001--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But does one remain conscious?
<!--l. 1003--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As the universe is the body of the mind, so is consciousness the
body of the supreme. It is not conscious, but it gives rise to
consciousness.
<!--l. 1005--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In my daily actions much goes by habit, automatically. I am aware
of the general purpose, but not of each movement in detail. As my
consciousness broadens and deepens, details tend to recede, leaving me
free for the general trends. Does not the same happens to a jnani, but
more so?
<!--l. 1007--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On the level of consciousness &#8211; yes. In the supreme state, no. This
state is entirely one and indivisible, a single solid block of reality. The
only way of knowing it is to be it. The mind cannot reach it. To
perceive it does not need the senses; to know it, does not need the
mind.
<!--l. 1009--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>That is how God runs the world.
<!--l. 1011--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then who is doing it?

<!--l. 1015--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nobody. All happens by itself. You are asking the question and you
are supplying the answer.
<!--l. 1017--><p class="noindent" >And you know the answer when you ask the question. All is a play in
consciousness. All divisions are illusory. You can know the false only.
The true you must yourself be.
<!--l. 1019--><p class="noindent" ><span

consciousness. Is the second the supreme?
<!--l. 1021--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There are the two &#8211; the person and the witness, the observer.
When you see them as one, and go beyond, you are in the supreme
state. It is not perceivable, because it is what makes perception
possible. It is beyond being and not being. It is neither the mirror nor
the image in the mirror. It is what is &#8211; the timeless reality, unbelievably
hard and solid.
<!--l. 1023--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The jnani &#8211; is he the witness or the Supreme?
<!--l. 1025--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He is the Supreme, of course, but he can also be viewed as the
universal witness.
<!--l. 1027--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But he remains a person?
<!--l. 1029--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you believe yourself to be a person, you see persons
everywhere. In reality there are no persons, only threads of memories
and habits. At the moment of realisation the person ceases.
<!--l. 1031--><p class="noindent" >Identity remains, but identity is not a person, it is inherent in the
reality itself. The person has no being in itself; it is a reflection in
the mind of the witness, the &#8216;I am&#8217;, which again is a mode of
being.
<!--l. 1033--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Pragnanam Brahma. What is this Pragna?
<!--l. 1039--><p class="noindent" ><span

Consciousness is most differentiated in the waking state. Less so in

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is consciousness. AII is conscious.
<!--l. 1053--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the source of consciousness?
<!--l. 1055--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness itself is the source of everything.
<!--l. 1057--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can there be life without consciousness?
<!--l. 1059--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No, nor consciousness without life. They are both one. But in
reality only the Ultimate is. The rest is a matter of name and form.
And as long as you cling to the idea that only what has name and
shape exists, the Supreme will appear to you non-existing. When you
understand that names and shapes are hollow shells without any

content whatsoever, and what is real is nameless and formless, pure
energy of life and light of consciousness, you will be at peace &#8211;
immersed in the deep silence of reality.
<!--l. 1061--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If time and space are mere illusions and you are beyond, please
tell me what is the weather in New York. Is it hot or raining
there?
<!--l. 1063--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can I tell you? Such things need special training. Or, just
travelling to New York. I may be quite certain that I am beyond time
and space, and yet unable to locate myself at will at some point of time
and space. I am not interested enough; I see no purpose in undergoing
a special Yogic training. I have just heard of New York. To me it is a
word. Why should I know more than the word conveys? Every atom
may be a universe, as complex as ours. Must I know them all? I can &#8211; if
I train.
<!--l. 1065--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In putting the question about the weather in New York, where did I
make the mistake?
<!--l. 1067--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world and the mind are states of being. The supreme is not a
state. It pervades, all states, but it is not a state of something else. It is
entirely uncaused, independent, complete in itself, beyond time and
space, mind and matter.
<!--l. 1069--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By what sign do you recognise it?
<!--l. 1071--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That&#8217;s the point that it leaves no traces. There is nothing to
recognise it by. It must be seen directly, by giving up all search for
signs and approaches. When all names and forms have been given up,
the real is with you. You need not seek it. Plurality and diversity are
the play of the mind only. Reality is one.
<!--l. 1073--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If reality leaves no evidence, there is no speaking about it.

<!--l. 1075--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is. It cannot be denied. It is deep and dark, mystery beyond
mystery. But it is, while all else merely happens.
<!--l. 1077--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it the Unknown?
<!--l. 1079--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is beyond both, the known and the unknown. But I would rather
call it the known, than the unknown. For whenever something is
known, it is the real that is known.
<!--l. 1081--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is silence an attribute of the real?
<!--l. 1083--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This too is of the mind. All states and conditions are of the
mind.
<!--l. 1085--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the place of samadhi?
<!--l. 1087--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not making use of one&#8217;s consciousness is samadhi. You just leave
your mind alone. You want nothing, neither-from your body nor from
your mind.

<!--l. 1090--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Repeatedly you have been saying that events are
causeless, a thing just happens and no cause can be assigned to it.
Surely everything has a cause, or several causes. How am I to
understand the causelessness of things?
<!--l. 1092--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>From the highest point of view the world has no cause.
<!--l. 1094--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But what is your own experience?
<!--l. 1096--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everything is uncaused. The world has no cause.
<!--l. 1098--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am not enquiring about the causes that led to the creation of the
world. Who has seen the creation of the world? It may even be without
a beginning, always existing. But I am not talking of the world. I take
the world to exist &#8211; somehow. It contains so many things. Surely, each
must have a cause, or several causes.
<!--l. 1100--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Once you create for yourself a world in time and space, governed by
causality, you are bound to search for and find causes for everything.
You put the question and impose an answer.
<!--l. 1102--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My question is very simple: I see all kinds of things and I
understand that each must have a cause, or a number of causes. You
say they are uncaused &#8211; from your point of view. But, to you nothing
has being and, therefore, the question of causation does not arise. Yet
you seem to admit the existence of things, but deny them causation.
This is what I cannot grasp. Once you accept the existence of things,
why reject their causes?
<!--l. 1104--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I see only consciousness, and know everything to be but
consciousness, as you know the picture on the cinema screen to be but
light.

<!--l. 1106--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still, the movements of light have a cause.
<!--l. 1108--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The light does not move at all. You know very well that the
movement is illusory, a sequence of interceptions and colour-ings in the
film. What moves is the film &#8211; which is the mind.
<!--l. 1110--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This does not make the picture causeless. The film is there, and the
actors with the technicians, the director, the producer, the various
manufacturers. The world is governed by causality.
<!--l. 1112--><p class="noindent" >Everything is inter-linked.
<!--l. 1114--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course, everything is inter-linked. And therefore everything has
numberless causes. The entire universe contributes to the least thing. A
thing is as it is, because the world is as it is. You see, you deal in gold
ornaments and I &#8211; in gold. Between the different ornaments there is no
causal relation. When you re-melt an ornament to make another, there
is no causal relation between the two. The common factor is the gold.
But you cannot say gold is the cause. It cannot be called a cause, for it
causes nothing by itself. It is reflected in the mind as &#8216;I am&#8217;, as the
ornament&#8217;s particular name and shape. Yet all is only gold. In the
same way reality makes everything possible and yet nothing
that makes a thing what it is, its name and form, comes from
reality.
<!--l. 1116--><p class="noindent" >But why worry so much about causation? What do causes matter,
when things themselves are transient? Let come what comes and let go
what goes &#8211; why catch hold of things and enquire about their
causes?
<!--l. 1118--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>From the relative point of view, everything must have a cause.
<!--l. 1120--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of what use is the relative view to you? You are able to look from
the absolute point of view &#8211;

<!--l. 1122--><p class="noindent" >why go back to the relative? Are you afraid of the absolute?
<!--l. 1124--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am afraid. I am afraid of falling asleep over my so-called
absolute certainties. For living a life decently absolutes don&#8217;t
help. When you need a shirt, you buy cloth, call a tailor and so
on.
<!--l. 1126--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All this talk shows ignorance.
<!--l. 1128--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what is the knower&#8217;s view?
<!--l. 1130--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is only light and the light is all. Everything else is but a
picture made of light. The picture is in the light and the light is in the
picture. Life and death, self and not-self &#8212; abandon all these ideas.
They are of no use to you.
<!--l. 1132--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>From what point of view you deny causation? From the relative &#8211;
the universe is the cause of everything. From the absolute &#8211; there is no
thing at all.
<!--l. 1134--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>From which state are you asking?
<!--l. 1136--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>From the daily waking state, in which alone all these discussions
take place.
<!--l. 1138--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In the waking state all these problems arise, for such is its
nature. But, you are not always in that state. What good can you
do in a state into which you fall and from which you emerge,
helplessly. In what way does it help you to know that things
are causally related &#8211; as they may appear to be in your waking
state?
<!--l. 1140--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The world and the waking state emerge and subside together.

<!--l. 1142--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When the mind is still, absolutely silent, the waking state is no
more.
<!--l. 1144--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Words like God, universe, the total, absolute, supreme are just
noises in the air, because no action can be taken on them.
<!--l. 1146--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are bringing up questions which you alone can answer.
<!--l. 1148--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Don&#8217;t brush me off like this! You are so quick to speak for the
totality, the universe and such imaginary things! They cannot come
and forbid you to talk on their behalf. I hate those irresponsible
generalizations! And you are so prone to personalise them. Without
causality there will be no order; nor purposeful action will be
possible.
<!--l. 1150--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Do you want to know all the causes of each event? Is it possible?
<!--l. 1152--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I know it is not possible! All I want to know is if there are causes for
everything and the causes can be influenced, thereby affecting the
events?
<!--l. 1154--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To influence events, you need not know the causes. What a
roundabout way of doing things!
<!--l. 1156--><p class="noindent" >Are you not the source and the end of every event? Control it at the
source itself.
<!--l. 1158--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Every morning I pick up the newspaper and read with dismay that
the world&#8217;s sorrows &#8211;
<!--l. 1160--><p class="noindent" >poverty, hatred and wars &#8211; continue unabated. My questions
are concerning the fact of sorrow, the cause, the remedy. Don&#8217;t
brush me off saying that it is Buddhism! Don&#8217;t label me. Your
insistence on causelessness removes all hope of the world ever

changing.
<!--l. 1162--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are confused, because you believe that you are in the world,
not the world in you. Who came first &#8211; you or your parents? You
imagine that you were born at a certain time and place, that you have
a father and a mother, a body and a name. This is your sin and your
calamity! Surely you can change your world if you work at it. By all
means, work. Who stops you? I have never discouraged you. Causes
or no causes, you have made this world and you can change
it.
<!--l. 1164--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A causeless world is entirely beyond my control.
<!--l. 1166--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On the contrary, a world of which you are the only source and
ground is fully within your power to change. What is created can be
always dissolved and re-created. All will happen as you want it,
provided you really want it.
<!--l. 1168--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All I want to know is how to deal with the world&#8217;s sorrows.
<!--l. 1170--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have created them out of your own desires and fears, you deal
with them. All is due to your having forgotten your own being. Having
given reality to the picture on the screen, you love its people and suffer
for them and seek to save them. It is just not so. You must begin with
yourself.
<!--l. 1172--><p class="noindent" >There is no other way. Work, of course. There is no harm in
working.
<!--l. 1174--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Your universe seems to contain every possible experience. The
individual traces a line through it and experiences pleasant and
unpleasant states. This gives rise to questioning and seeking, which
broaden the outlook and enable the individual to go beyond his narrow
and self-created world limited and self-centred. This personal

world can be changed &#8211; in time. The universe is timeless and
perfect.
<!--l. 1176--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To take appearance for reality is a grievous sin and the cause of all
calamities. You are the all-pervading, eternal and infinitely creative
awareness &#8211; consciousness. All else is local and temporary. Don&#8217;t forget
what you are. In the meantime work to your heart&#8217;s content. Work and
knowledge should go hand in hand.
<!--l. 1178--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My own feeling is that my spiritual development is not in my
hands. Making one&#8217;s own plans and carrying them out leads no
where. I just run in circles round myself. When God considers
the fruit to be ripe, He will pluck it and eat it. Whichever fruit
seems green to Him will remain on the world&#8217;s tree for another
day.
<!--l. 1180--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You think God knows you? Even the world He does not
know.
<!--l. 1182--><p class="noindent" ><span

suffers along with us.
<!--l. 1184--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You pray to save one, while thousands die. And if all stop dying,
there will be no space on earth Q: I am not afraid of death. My concern
is with sorrow and suffering. My God is a simple God and rather
helpless. He has no power to compel us to be wise. He can only stand
and wait.
<!--l. 1186--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you and your God are both helpless, does it not imply that the
world is accidental? And if it is.

<!--l. 1310--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I have met many realised people, but never a liberated
man. Have you come across a liberated man, or does liberation mean,
among other things, also abandoning the body?
<!--l. 1312--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>What do you mean by realisation and liberation?
<!--l. 1314--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By realisation I mean a wonderful experience of peace, goodness
and beauty, when the world makes sense and there is an all-pervading
unity of both substance and essence. While such experience does not
last, it cannot be forgotten. It shines in the mind, both as memory and
longing.
<!--l. 1316--><p class="noindent" >I know what I am talking about, for I have had such experiences.
<!--l. 1318--><p class="noindent" >By liberation I mean to be permanently in that wonderful state. What
I am asking is whether liberation is compatible with the survival of the
body.
<!--l. 1320--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is wrong with the body?
<!--l. 1322--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The body is so weak and short-lived. It creates needs and cravings.
It limits one grievously.
<!--l. 1324--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So what? Let the physical expressions be limited. But liberation is
of the self from its false and self-imposed ideas; it is not contained in
some particular experience, however glorious.
<!--l. 1326--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it last for ever?
<!--l. 1328--><p class="noindent" ><span

an end.

<!--l. 1330--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So liberation, in my sense of the word, does not exist?
<!--l. 1332--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On the contrary, one is always free. You are, both conscious and
free to be conscious. Nobody can take this away from you. Do you ever
know yourself non-existing, or unconscious?
<!--l. 1334--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I may not remember, but that does not disprove my being
occasionally unconscious.
<!--l. 1336--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why not turn away from the experience to the experiencer and
realise the full import of the only true statement you can make: &#8216;I
am&#8217;?
<!--l. 1338--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is it done?
<!--l. 1340--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no &#8216;how&#8217; here. Just keep in mind the feeling &#8216;I am&#8217;, merge
in it, till your mind and feeling become one. By repeated attempts you
will stumble on the right balance of attention and affection and your
mind will be firmly established in the thought-feeling &#8216;I am&#8217;.
Whatever you think, say, or do, this sense of immutable and
affectionate being remains as the ever-present background of the
mind.
<!--l. 1342--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And you call it liberation?
<!--l. 1344--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I call it normal. What is wrong with being, knowing and acting
effortlessly and happily? Why consider it so unusual as to expect the
immediate destruction of the body? What is wrong with the body that
it should die? Correct your attitude to your body and leave it alone.
Don&#8217;t pamper, don&#8217;t torture. Just keep it going, most of the time below
the threshold of conscious attention.
<!--l. 1346--><p class="noindent" ><span

back.

<!--l. 1348--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because you want them back, you cannot have them. The state
of craving for anything blocks all deeper experience. Nothing
of value can happen to a mind which knows exactly what it
wants.
<!--l. 1350--><p class="noindent" >For nothing the mind can visualise and want is of much value.

Desirelessness is the highest bliss.
<!--l. 1356--><p class="noindent" ><span

doing nothing else.

<!--l. 1366--><p class="noindent" ><span

desires, why don&#8217;t you?
<!--l. 1368--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1370--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What happened to your energy? Where did it go? Did you not
scatter it over so many contradictory desires and pursuits? You don&#8217;t
have an infinite supply of energy.
<!--l. 1372--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why not?

<!--l. 1374--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your aims are small and low. They do not call for more. Only
God&#8217;s energy is infinite &#8211; because He wants nothing for Himself. Be like
Him and all your desires will be fulfilled. The higher your aims
and vaster your desires, the more energy you will have for their
fulfilment. Desire the good of all and the universe will work with you.
But if you want your own pleasure, you must earn it the hard
way.

<!--l. 1378--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am engaged in the study of philosophy, sociology and education. I
think more mental development is needed before I can dream of
self-realisation. Am I on the right track?
<!--l. 1380--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To earn a livelihood some specialised knowledge is needed. General
knowledge develops the mind, no doubt. But if you are going to
spend your life in amassing knowledge, you build a wall round
yourself. To go beyond the mind, a well- furnished mind is not
needed.
<!--l. 1382--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1392--><p class="noindent" ><span

goal. You may begin with selfless work, abandoning the fruits of
action; you may then give up thinking and end in giving up all
desires.

<!--l. 1394--><p class="noindent" >Here, giving up ( tyaga) is the operational factor. Or, you may not
bother about any thing you want, or think, or do and just stay put in
the thought and feeling &#8216;I am&#8217;, focussing &#8216;I am&#8217; firmly in your
mind.
<!--l. 1396--><p class="noindent" >All kinds of experience may come to you &#8211; remain unmoved in the
knowledge that all perceivable is transient, and only the &#8216;I am&#8217;
endures.
<!--l. 1398--><p class="noindent" ><span

attend to.
<!--l. 1400--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means attend to your duties. Action, in which you are
not emotionally involved and which is beneficial and does not
cause suffering will not bind you. You may be engaged in several
directions and work with enormous zest, yet remain inwardly free and
quiet, with a mirror-like mind, which reflects all, without being
affected.
<!--l. 1402--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is such a state realisable?
<!--l. 1404--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1408--><p class="noindent" ><span

came to get the needed guidance. Kindly tell me what am I to
do?

<!--l. 1412--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1414--><p class="noindent" ><span

personal instructions.
<!--l. 1416--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your own self is your ultimate teacher ( sadguru). The outer
teacher (Guru) is merely a milestone. It is only your inner teacher, that

Look within, and you will find him.
<!--l. 1422--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1424--><p class="noindent" ><span

He alone is, all else only appears to be. He is your own self ( swarupa),
your hope and assurance of freedom; find him and cling to him and you
will be saved and safe.
<!--l. 1426--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1438--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am.
<!--l. 1444--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So, you know the witness because you are the witness. You
need not see the witness in front of you. Here again, to be is to
know.
<!--l. 1446--><p class="noindent" ><span

way does it profit me?
<!--l. 1448--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What a question! What kind of profit do you expect? To know
what you are, is it not good enough?
<!--l. 1450--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What are the uses of self-knowledge?
<!--l. 1452--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It helps you to understand what you are not and keeps you free
from false ideas, desires and actions.
<!--l. 1454--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1456--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What helps you to know yourself is right. What prevents, is wrong.
To know one&#8217;s real self is bliss, to forget &#8211; is sorrow.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is the witness-consciousness the real Self?
<!--l. 1460--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is the reflection of the real in the mind ( buddhi). The
real is beyond. The witness is the door through which you pass

beyond.

<!--l. 1464--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1468--><p class="noindent" ><span

one.

<!--l. 1472--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No way is short or long, but some people are more in earnest and
some are less. I can tell you about myself. I was a simple man, but I
trusted my Guru. What he told me to do, I did. He told me to
concentrate on &#8216;I am&#8217; &#8211; I did. He told me that I am beyond all
perceivables and conceivables &#8211; I believed. I gave him my heart
and soul, my entire attention and the whole of my spare time (I
had to work to keep my family alive). As a result of faith and
earnest application, I realised my self ( swarupa) within three
years.

<!--l. 1482--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>The highest powers of the mind are understanding,
intelligence and insight. Man has three bodies &#8211; the physical, the
mental and the causal ( prana, mana, karana). The physical reflects his
being; the mental &#8211; his knowing and the causal &#8211; his joyous creativity.
Of course, these are all forms in consciousness. But they appear to be
separate, with qualities of their own. Intelligence ( buddhi) is the
reflection in the mind of the power to know ( chit). It is what makes
the mind knowledgeable. The brighter the intelligence, the wider,
deeper and truer the knowledge. To know things, to know people and
to know oneself are all functions of intelligence: the last is the most
important and contains the former two. Misunderstanding oneself and
the world leads to false ideas and desires, which again lead to bondage.
Right understanding of oneself is necessary for freedom from the
bondage of illusion. I understand all this in theory, but when it comes
to practice, I find that I fail hopelessly in my responses to situations
and people and by my inappropriate reactions I merely add to
my bondage. Life is too quick for my dull and slow mind. I do
understand but too late, when the old mistakes have been already
repeated.
<!--l. 1484--><p class="noindent" ><span

cannot be quick unless it is perfectly spontaneous. How can I achieve
such spontaneity?
<!--l. 1488--><p class="noindent" ><span

keep bright. As soon as the mind is ready, the sun shines in
it.
<!--l. 1490--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The light is of the Self, or of the mind?

<!--l. 1492--><p class="noindent" ><span

mind, as it moves and changes.
<!--l. 1494--><p class="noindent" >It is very much like a cinema. The light is not in the film, but the film
colours the light and makes it appear to move by intercepting

<h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">Chapter&#x00A0;18</span><br /><a
 id="x1-2300018"></a>To Know What you Are, Find What you Are Not</h2>
<!--l. 1532--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Your way of describing the universe as consisting of
matter, mind and spirit is one of the many. There are other patterns to
which the universe is expected to conform, and one is at a loss to know
which pattern is true and which is not. One ends in suspecting that all
patterns are only verbal and that no pattern can contain reality.
According to you, reality consists of three expanses: The expanse of
matter-energy ( mahadakash), the expanse of consciousness (
chidakash) and of pure spirit ( paramakash). The first is something
that has both movement and inertia. That we perceive. We also know
that we perceive &#8211; we are conscious and also aware of being
conscious.
<!--l. 1534--><p class="noindent" >Thus, we have two: matter-energy and consciousness. Matter seems to
be in space while energy is always in time, being connected with change
and measured by the rate of change. Consciousness seems to be
somehow here and now, in a single point of time and space. But you
seem to suggest that consciousness too is universal &#8211; which makes it
timeless, spaceless and impersonal. I can somehow understand that
there is no contradiction between the timeless and spaceless and the
here and now, but impersonal consciousness I cannot fathom. To me
consciousness is always focalised, centred, individualised, a person. You
seem to say that there can be perceiving without a perceiver,
knowing without a knower, loving without a lover, acting without
an actor. I feel that the trinity of knowing, knower and known
can be seen in every movement of life. Consciousness implies a
conscious being, an object of consciousness and the fact of being
conscious. That which is conscious I call a person. A person
lives in the world, is a part of it, affects it and is affected by
it.
<!--l. 1536--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, I am real enough to merit your reply and I am a
person.
<!--l. 1548--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not when asleep.
<!--l. 1550--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Submergence is not absence. Even though asleep, I am.
<!--l. 1552--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To be a person you must be self-conscious. Are you so always?
<!--l. 1554--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Not when I sleep, of course, nor when I am in a swoon, or
drugged.
<!--l. 1556--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>During your waking hours are you continually self-conscious?
<!--l. 1558--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No, Sometimes I am absent-minded, or just absorbed.
<!--l. 1560--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Are you a person during the gaps in self-consciousness?
<!--l. 1562--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Of course I am the same person throughout. I remember myself
as I was yesterday and yester year &#8211; definitely, I am the same
person.
<!--l. 1564--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So, to be a person, you need memory?

<!--l. 1566--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Of course.
<!--l. 1568--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>And without memory, what are you?
<!--l. 1570--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Incomplete memory entails incomplete personality. Without
memory I cannot exist as a person.
<!--l. 1572--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Surely you can exist without memory. You do so &#8211; in sleep.
<!--l. 1574--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Only in the sense of remaining alive. Not as a person.
<!--l. 1576--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Since you admit that as a person you have only intermittent
existence, can you tell me what are you in the intervals in between
experiencing yourself as a person?
<!--l. 1578--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am, but not as a person. Since I am not conscious of myself in the
intervals, I can only say that I exist, but not as a person.
<!--l. 1580--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Shall we call it impersonal existence?
<!--l. 1582--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I would call it rather unconscious existence; I am, but I do not know
that I am.
<!--l. 1584--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have said just now: &#8216;I am, but I do not know that I am&#8217;.
Could you possibly say it about your being in an unconscious
state?
<!--l. 1586--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No, I could not.
<!--l. 1588--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can only describe it in the past tense: &#8216;I did not know. I was
unconscious&#8217;, in the sense of not remembering.
<!--l. 1590--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Having been unconscious, how could I remember and what?

<!--l. 1592--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Were you really unconscious, or you just do not remember?
<!--l. 1594--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to make out?
<!--l. 1596--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consider. Do you remember every second of yesterday?
<!--l. 1598--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Of course, not.
<!--l. 1600--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Were you then unconscious?
<!--l. 1602--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Of course, not.
<!--l. 1604--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So, you are conscious and yet you do not remember?
<!--l. 1606--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes.
<!--l. 1608--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe you were conscious in sleep and just do not remember.
<!--l. 1610--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No, I was not conscious. I was asleep. I did not behave like a
conscious person.
<!--l. 1612--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again, how do you know?
<!--l. 1614--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I was told so by those who saw me asleep.
<!--l. 1616--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All they can testify to is that they saw you lying quietly with
closed eyes and breathing regularly.
<!--l. 1618--><p class="noindent" >They could not make out whether you were conscious or not. Your only
proof is your own memory.
<!--l. 1620--><p class="noindent" >A very uncertain proof it is!
<!--l. 1622--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, I admit that on my own terms I am a person only during my

waking hours. What I am in between, I do not know.
<!--l. 1624--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>At least you know that you do not know! Since you pretend not to
be conscious in the intervals between the waking hours, leave the
intervals alone. Let us consider the waking hours only.
<!--l. 1626--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am the same person in my dreams.
<!--l. 1628--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Agreed. Let us consider them together waking and dreaming. The
difference is merely in continuity. Were your dreams consistently
continuous, bringing back night after night the same surroundings and
the same people, you would be at a loss to know which is the waking
and which is the dream. Henceforward, when we talk of the waking
state, we shall include the dream state too.
<!--l. 1630--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Agreed. I am a person in a conscious relation with a world.
<!--l. 1632--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Are the world and the conscious relation with it essential to your
being a person?
<!--l. 1634--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even immersed in a cave, I remain a person.
<!--l. 1636--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It implies a body and a cave. And a world in which they can
exist.
<!--l. 1638--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes. I can see. The world and the consciousness of the world are
essential to my existence as a person.
<!--l. 1640--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This makes the person a part and parcel of the world, or vice versa.
The two are one.
<!--l. 1642--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Consciousness stands alone. The person and the world appear in
consciousness.

<!--l. 1644--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You said: appear. Could you add: disappear?
<!--l. 1646--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No, I cannot. I can only be aware of my and my world&#8217;s appearance.
As a person, I cannot say: &#8216;the world is not&#8217;. Without a world I would
not be there to say it. Because there is a world, I am there to say:
&#8216;there is a world&#8217;.
<!--l. 1649--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe it is the other way round. Because of you, there is a
world.
<!--l. 1651--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To me such statement appears meaningless.
<!--l. 1653--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Its meaninglessness may disappear on investigation.
<!--l. 1655--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Where do we begin?
<!--l. 1657--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All I know is that whatever depends, is not real. The real is truly
independent. Since the existence of the person depends on the existence
of the world and it is circumscribed and defined by the world, it cannot
be real.
<!--l. 1659--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It cannot be a dream, surely.
<!--l. 1661--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Even a dream has existence, when it is cognised and enjoyed, or
endured. Whatever you think and feel has being. But it may not be
what you take it to be. What you think to be a person may be
something quite different.
<!--l. 1663--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am what I know myself to be.
<!--l. 1665--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You cannot possibly say that you are what you think yourself to
be! Your ideas about yourself change from day to day and from
moment to moment. Your self-image is the most changeful thing you
have. It is utterly vulnerable, at the mercy of a passer by. A

bereavement, the loss of a job, an insult, and your image of yourself,
which you call your person, changes deeply. To know what you are you
must first investigate and know what you are not. And to know what
you are not you must watch yourself carefully, rejecting all that does
not necessarily go with the basic fact: &#8216;I am&#8217;. The ideas: I am born at a
given place, at a given time, from my parents and now I am so-and-so,
living at, married to, father of, employed by, and so on, are not
inherent in the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;. Our usual attitude is of &#8216;I am this&#8217;.
Separate consistently and perseveringly the &#8216;I am&#8217; from &#8216;this&#8217; or &#8216;that&#8217;,
and try to feel what it means to be, just to be, without being &#8216;this&#8217; or
&#8216;that&#8217;. All our habits go against it and the task of fighting them
is long and hard sometimes, but clear understanding helps a
lot. The clearer you understand that on the level of the mind
you can be described in negative terms only, the quicker you
will come to the end of your search and realise your limitless
being.

<!--l. 1668--><p class="noindent" ><span

value from the spiritual point of view?
<!--l. 1670--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>When you paint what do you think about?
<!--l. 1672--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I paint, there is only the painting and myself.
<!--l. 1674--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What are you doing there?
<!--l. 1676--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I paint.
<!--l. 1678--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No, you don&#8217;t. You see the painting going on. You are watching
only, all else happens.
<!--l. 1680--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The picture is painting itself? Or, is there some deeper &#8216;me&#8217;, or
some god who is painting?
<!--l. 1682--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness itself is the greatest painter. The entire world is a
Picture.
<!--l. 1684--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who painted the picture of the world?
<!--l. 1686--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The painter is in the Picture.
<!--l. 1688--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The picture is in the mind of the painter and the painter is in the
picture, which is in the mind of the painter who is in the picture! Is not
this infinity of states and dimensions absurd? The moment we talk of
picture in the mind, which itself is in the picture, we come to an
endless succession of witnesses, the higher witness witnessing the lower.
It is like standing between two mirrors and wondering at the
crowd!

<!--l. 1690--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite right, you alone and the double mirror are there. Between the
two, your forms and names are numberless.
<!--l. 1692--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do you look at the world?
<!--l. 1694--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I see a painter painting a picture. The picture I call the world, the
painter I call God. I am neither.
<!--l. 1696--><p class="noindent" >I do not create, nor am I created. I contain all, nothing contains
me.
<!--l. 1698--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I see a tree, a face, a sunset, the picture is perfect. When I
close my eyes, the image in my mind is faint and hazy. If it is my mind
that projects the picture, why need I open my eyes to see a lovely
flower and with eyes closed I see it vaguely?
<!--l. 1700--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is because your outer eyes are better than your inner eyes. Your
mind is all turned outward.
<!--l. 1702--><p class="noindent" >As you learn to watch your mental world, you will find it even more
colourful and perfect than what the body can provide. Of course, you
will need some training. But why argue? You imagine that the picture
must come from the painter who actually painted it. All the time you
look for origins and causes. Causality is in the mind, only; memory
gives the illusion of continuity and repetitiveness creates the idea of
causality. When things repeatedly happen together, we tend to see a
causal link between them. It creates a mental habit, but a habit is not
a necessity.
<!--l. 1704--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You have just said that the world is made by God.
<!--l. 1706--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Remember that language is an instrument of the mind; It is made
by the mind, for the mind.

<!--l. 1708--><p class="noindent" >Once you admit a cause, then God is the ultimate cause and the world
the effect. They are different, but not separate.
<!--l. 1710--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>People talk of seeing God.
<!--l. 1712--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you see the world you see God. There is no seeing God,
apart from the world. Beyond the world to see God is to be God. The
light by which you see the world, which is God is the tiny little spark:
&#8216;I am&#8217;, apparently so small, yet the first and the last in every act of
knowing and loving.
<!--l. 1714--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must I see the world to see God?
<!--l. 1716--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How else? No world, no God.
<!--l. 1718--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What remains?
<!--l. 1720--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You remain as pure being.
<!--l. 1722--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what becomes of the world and of God?
<!--l. 1724--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pure being ( avyakta).
<!--l. 1726--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it the same as the Great Expanse ( paramakash)?
<!--l. 1728--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You may call it so. Words do not matter, for they do not reach it.
They turn back in utter negation.
<!--l. 1730--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I see the world as God? What does it mean to see the
world as God?
<!--l. 1732--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is like entering a dark room. You see nothing &#8211; you may touch,
but you do not see &#8211; no colours, no outlines. The window opens and the
room is flooded with light. Colours and shapes come into being. The

window is the giver of light, but not the source of it. The sun is the
source.
<!--l. 1734--><p class="noindent" >Similarly, matter is like the dark room; consciousness &#8211; the window &#8211;
flooding matter with sensations and perceptions, and the Supreme is
the sun the source both of matter and of light. The window may be
closed, or open, the sun shines all the time. It makes all the difference
to the room, but none to the sun. Yet all this is secondary to the
tiny little thing which is the &#8216;I am&#8217;. Without the &#8216;I am&#8217; there is
nothing. All knowledge is about the &#8216;I am&#8217;. False ideas about this
&#8216;I am&#8217; lead to bondage, right knowledge leads to freedom and
happiness.
<!--l. 1736--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>&#8216;I am&#8217; denotes the inner, &#8216;there is&#8217; &#8211; the outer. Both are based on
the sense of being.
<!--l. 1740--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it the same as the experience of existence?
<!--l. 1742--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To exist means to be something, a thing, a feeling, a thought, an
idea. All existence is particular.
<!--l. 1744--><p class="noindent" >Only being is universal, in the sense that every being is compatible
with every other being.
<!--l. 1746--><p class="noindent" >Existences clash, being &#8211; never. Existence means becoming, change,
birth and death and birth again, while in being there is silent
peace.
<!--l. 1748--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I create the world, why have I made it bad?
<!--l. 1750--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everyone lives in his own world. Not all the worlds are equally good
or bad.

<!--l. 1752--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What determines the difference?
<!--l. 1754--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind that projects the world, colours it its own way.
When you meet a man, he is a stranger. When you marry him,
he becomes your own self. When you quarrel, he becomes your
enemy. It is your mind&#8217;s attitude that determines what he is to
you.
<!--l. 1756--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can see that my world is subjective. Does it make it also
illusory?
<!--l. 1758--><p class="noindent" ><span

Reality lies in objectivity.
<!--l. 1760--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1766--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It does not depend on memories and expectations, desires and
fears, likes and dislikes. All is seen as it is.
<!--l. 1768--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1778--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>You say, reality is one. Oneness, unity, is the attribute of
the person. Is then reality a person, with the universe as its
body?
<!--l. 1780--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Whatever you may say will be both true and false. Words
do not reach beyond the mind.
<!--l. 1782--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am just trying to understand. You are telling us of the Person, the
Self and the Supreme.
<!--l. 1784--><p class="noindent" >( vyakti, vyakta, avyakta). The light of Pure Awareness ( pragna),
focussed as &#8216;I am&#8217; in the Self ( jivatma), as consciousness ( chetana)
illumines the mind ( antahkarana) and as life ( prana) vitalises the
body ( deha). All this is fine as far as the words go. But when it comes
to distinguishing in myself the person from the Self and the Self from
the Supreme, I get mixed up.
<!--l. 1786--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The person is never the subject. You can see a person, but you are
not the person. You are always the Supreme which appears at a given
point of time and space as the witness, a bridge between the pure
awareness of the Supreme and the manifold consciousness of the
person.
<!--l. 1788--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I look at myself, I find I am several persons fighting among
themselves for the use of the body.
<!--l. 1790--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1794--><p class="noindent" ><span

mere habits of thoughts and feelings, bundles of memories and

<!--l. 1798--><p class="noindent" ><span

that whatever appears before you cannot be yourself, and cannot say &#8216;I
am&#8217;, you are free of all your &#8216;persons&#8217; and their demands. The
sense &#8216;I am&#8217; is your own. You cannot part with it, but you can
impart it to anything, as in saying: I am young. I am rich etc.
But such self-identifications are patently false and the cause of
bondage.

Now, about the Supreme? In what way do I know myself as the
Supreme?
<!--l. 1802--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The source of consciousness cannot be an object in consciousness.
To know the source is to be the source. When you realise that you are
not the person, but the pure and calm witness, and that fearless

Inexhaustible Possibility.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Shapes and names are all of one and the same God?
<!--l. 1810--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again, it all depends on how you look at it. On the verbal

level everything is relative. Absolutes should be experienced, not
discussed.
<!--l. 1812--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is the Absolute experienced?
<!--l. 1814--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not an object to be recognised and stored up in memory. It is
in the present and in feeling rather. It has more to do with the &#8216;how&#8217;
than with the &#8216;what&#8217;. It is in the quality, in the value; being the source
of everything, it is in everything.
<!--l. 1816--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If it is the source, why and how does it manifest itself?
<!--l. 1818--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It gives birth to consciousness. All else is in consciousness.
<!--l. 1820--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why are there so many centres of consciousness?
<!--l. 1822--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The objective universe ( mahadakash) is in constant movement,
projecting and dissolving innumerable forms. Whenever a form is
infused with life ( prana), consciousness ( chetana) appears by
reflection of awareness in matter.
<!--l. 1824--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is the Supreme affected?
<!--l. 1826--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What can affect it and how? The source is not affected by the
vagaries of the river nor is the metal &#8211; by the shape of the jewellery. Is
the light affected by the picture on the screen? The Supreme makes
everything possible, that is all.
<!--l. 1828--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is it that some things do happen and some don&#8217;t?
<!--l. 1830--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Seeking out causes is a pastime of the mind. There is no duality of
cause and effect. Everything is its own cause.
<!--l. 1832--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No purposeful action is then possible?

<!--l. 1834--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All I say is that consciousness contains all. In consciousness all is
possible. You can have causes if you want them, in your world. Another
may be content with a single cause &#8211; God&#8217;s will.
<!--l. 1836--><p class="noindent" >The root cause is one: the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;.
<!--l. 1838--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the link between the Self ( Vyakta) and the Supreme (
Avyakta)?
<!--l. 1840--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>From the self&#8217;s point of view the world is the known, the Supreme &#8211;
the Unknown. The Unknown gives birth to the known, yet remains
Unknown. The known is infinite, but the Unknown is an infinitude of
infinities. Just like a ray of light is never seen unless intercepted by the
specs of dust, so does the Supreme make everything known, itself
remaining unknown.
<!--l. 1842--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it mean that the Unknown is inaccessible?
<!--l. 1844--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Oh, no. The Supreme is the easiest to reach for it is your very
being. It is enough to stop thinking and desiring anything, but the
Supreme.
<!--l. 1846--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And if I desire nothing, not even the Supreme?
<!--l. 1848--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1850--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The world is full of desires: Everybody wants something or other.
Who is the desirer? The person or the self?
<!--l. 1852--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The self. All desires, holy and unholy, come from the self; they all
hang on the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;.
<!--l. 1854--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can understand holy desires ( satyakama) emanating from the self.
It may be the expression of the bliss aspect of the Sadchitananda

(Beingness &#8211; Awareness &#8211;Happiness) of the Self. But why unholy
desires?
<!--l. 1856--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All desires aim at happiness. Their shape and quality depend on
the psyche ( antahkarana).
<!--l. 1858--><p class="noindent" >Where inertia ( tamas) predominates, we find perversions. With
energy ( rajas), passions arise. With lucidity ( sattva) the motive
behind the desire is goodwill, compassion, the urge to make
happy rather than be happy. But the Supreme is beyond all,
yet because of its infinite permeability all cogent desires can be
fulfilled.
<!--l. 1860--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Which desires are cogent?
<!--l. 1862--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Desires that destroy their subjects, or objects, or do not subside on
satisfaction are self-contradictory and cannot be fulfilled. Only desires
motivated by love, goodwill and compassion are beneficial to both the
subject and object and can be fully satisfied.
<!--l. 1864--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All desires are painful, the holy as well as the unholy.
<!--l. 1866--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They are not the same and pain is not the same. Passion is painful,
compassion &#8211; never. The entire universe strives to fulfil a desire born of
compassion.
<!--l. 1868--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does the Supreme know itself? Is the Impersonal conscious?
<!--l. 1870--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The source of all has all. Whatever flows from it must be there
already in seed form. And as a seed is the last of innumerable
seeds, and contains the experience and the promise of numberless
forests, so does the Unknown contain all that was, or could have
been and all that shall or would be. The entire field of becoming
is open and accessible; past and future co-exist in the eternal

now.
<!--l. 1872--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you living in the Supreme Unknown?
<!--l. 1874--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 1876--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What makes you say so?
<!--l. 1878--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No desire ever arises in my mind.
<!--l. 1880--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you then unconscious?
<!--l. 1882--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course not! I am fully conscious, but since no desire or fear
enters my mind, there is perfect silence.
<!--l. 1884--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who knows the silence?
<!--l. 1886--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Silence knows itself. It is the silence of the silent mind, when
passions and desires are silenced.
<!--l. 1888--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you experience desires occasionally?
<!--l. 1890--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Desires are just waves in the mind. You know a wave when you see
one. A desire is just a thing among many. I feel no urge to satisfy it, no
action needs be taken on it. Freedom from desire means this: the
compulsion to satisfy is absent.
<!--l. 1892--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why do desires arise at all?
<!--l. 1894--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because you imagine that you were born, and that you will die if
you do not take care of your body. Desire for embodied existence is the
root-cause of trouble.
<!--l. 1896--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet, so many jivas get into bodies. Surely it cannot be some

error of judgement. There must be a purpose. What could it
be?
<!--l. 1898--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To know itself the self must be faced with its opposite &#8211; the
not-self. Desire leads to experience.
<!--l. 1900--><p class="noindent" >Experience leads to discrimination, detachment, self-knowledge &#8211;
liberation. And what is liberation after all? To know that you are
beyond birth and death. By forgetting who you are and imagining
yourself a mortal creature, you created so much trouble for yourself
that you have to wake up, like from a bad dream.
<!--l. 1902--><p class="noindent" >Enquiry also wakes you up. You need not wait for suffering;
enquiry into happiness is better, for the mind is in harmony and
peace.
<!--l. 1904--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who exactly is the ultimate experiencer &#8211; the Self or the
Unknown?
<!--l. 1906--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The Self, of course.
<!--l. 1908--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then why introduce the notion of the Supreme Unknown?
<!--l. 1910--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To explain the Self.
<!--l. 1912--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But is there anything beyond the Self?
<!--l. 1914--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Outside the Self there is nothing. All is one and all is contained in
&#8216;I am&#8217;. In the waking and dream states it is the person. In deep sleep
and turiya it is the Self. Beyond the alert intentness of turiya lies the
great, silent peace of the Supreme. But in fact all is one in essence and
related in appearance. In ignorance the seer becomes the seen and in
wisdom he is the seeing.

<!--l. 1916--><p class="noindent" >But why be concerned with the Supreme? Know the knowers and all
will be known.

 id="x1-2600021"></a>Who am I?</h2>
<!--l. 1920--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>We are advised to worship reality personified as God, or
as the Perfect Man. We are told not to attempt the worship
of the Absolute, as it is much too difficult for a brain-centred
consciousness.
<!--l. 1922--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Truth is simple and open to all. Why do you complicate?
Truth is loving and lovable. It includes all, accepts all, purifies all. It is
untruth that is difficult and a source of trouble. It always wants,
expects, demands. Being false, it is empty, always in search of
confirmation and reassurance. It is afraid of and avoids enquiry. It
identifies itself with any support, however weak and momentary.
Whatever it gets, it loses and asks for more. Therefore put no faith in
the conscious. Nothing you can see, feel, or think is so. Even sin and
virtue, merit and demerit are not what they appear. Usually
the bad and the good are a matter of convention and custom
and are shunned or welcomed, according to how the words are
used.
<!--l. 1924--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are there not good desires and bad, high desires and low?
<!--l. 1926--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All desires are bad, but some are worse than others. Pursue any
desire, it will always give you trouble.
<!--l. 1928--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even the desire to be free of desire?
<!--l. 1930--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why desire at all? Desiring a state of freedom from desire will not
set you free. Nothing can set you free, because you are free. See yourself
with desireless clarity, that is all.
<!--l. 1932--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It takes time to know oneself.
<!--l. 1934--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can time help you? Time is a succession of moments; each

moment appears out of nothing and disappears into nothing, never to
reappear. How can you build on something so fleeting?
<!--l. 1936--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is permanent?
<!--l. 1938--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Look to yourself for the permanent. Dive deep within and find what
is real in you.
<!--l. 1940--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How to look for myself?
<!--l. 1942--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whatever happens, it happens to you. What you do, the doer is in
you. Find the subject of all that you are as a person.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What else can I be?
<!--l. 1946--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Find out. Even if I tell you that you are the witness, the silent
watcher, it will mean nothing to you, unless you find the way to your
own being.
<!--l. 1948--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My question is: How to find the way to one&#8217;s own being?
<!--l. 1950--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Give up all questions except one: &#8216;Who am l&#8217;? After all, the only
fact you are sure of is that you are. The &#8216;I am&#8217; is certain. The &#8216;I am
this&#8217; is not. Struggle to find out what you are in reality.
<!--l. 1952--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am doing nothing else for the last 60 years.
<!--l. 1954--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is wrong with striving? Why look for results? Striving itself
is your real nature.
<!--l. 1956--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Striving is painful.
<!--l. 1958--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You make it so by seeking results. Strive without seeking, struggle
without greed.

<!--l. 1960--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why has God made me as I am?
<!--l. 1962--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Which God are you talking about? What is God? Is he not the very
light by which you ask the question? &#8216;I am&#8217; itself is God. The
seeking itself is God. In seeking you discover that you are neither
the body nor mind, and the love of the self in you is for the
self in all. The two are one. The consciousness in you and the
consciousness in me, apparently two, really one, seek unity and that is
love.
<!--l. 1964--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to find that love?
<!--l. 1966--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What do you love now? The &#8216;I am&#8217;. Give your heart and mind to it,
think of nothing else. This, when effortless and natural, is the highest
state. In it love itself is the lover and the beloved.
<!--l. 1968--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Everybody wants to live, to exist. Is it not self-love?
<!--l. 1970--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All desire has its source in the self. It is all a matter of choosing the
right desire.
<!--l. 1972--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is right and what is wrong varies with habit and custom.
Standards vary with societies.
<!--l. 1974--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Discard all traditional standards. Leave them to the hypocrites.
Only what liberates you from desire and fear and wrong ideas is
good. As long as you worry about sin and virtue you will have no
peace.
<!--l. 1976--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I grant that sin and virtue are social norms. But there may be also
spiritual sins and virtues. I mean by spiritual the absolute. Is there
such a thing as absolute sin or absolute virtue?
<!--l. 1978--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Sin and virtue refer to a person only. Without a sinful or virtuous

person what is sin or virtue? At the level of the absolute there are no
persons; the ocean of pure awareness is neither virtuous nor sinful. Sin
and virtue are invariably relative.
<!--l. 1980--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can I do away with such unnecessary notions?
<!--l. 1982--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not as long as you think yourself to be a person.
<!--l. 1984--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By what sign shall l know that I am beyond sin and virtue?
<!--l. 1986--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By being free from all desire and fear, from the very idea of being a
person. To nourish the ideas: &#8216;I am a sinner&#8217; &#8216;I am not a sinner&#8217;, is sin.
To identify oneself with the particular is all the sin there is. The
impersonal is real, the personal appears and disappears. &#8216;I am&#8217; is the
impersonal Being. &#8216;I am this&#8217; is the person. The person is relative and
the pure Being &#8211; fundamental.
<!--l. 1988--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely pure Being is not unconscious, nor is it devoid of
discrimination. How can it be beyond sin and virtue? Just tell us,
please, has it intelligence or not?
<!--l. 1990--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All these questions arise from your believing yourself to be a
person. Go beyond the personal and see.
<!--l. 1992--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What exactly do you mean when you ask me to stop being a
person?
<!--l. 1994--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I do not ask you to stop being &#8211; that you cannot. I ask you only to
stop imagining that you were born, have parents, are a body, will die
and so on. Just try, make a beginning &#8211; it is not as hard as you
think.
<!--l. 1996--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To think oneself as the personal is the sin of the impersonal.

<!--l. 1998--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again the personal point of view! Why do you insist on polluting
the impersonal with your ideas of sin and virtue? It just does not
apply. The impersonal cannot be described in terms of good
and bad. It is Being &#8211; Wisdom &#8211; Love &#8211; all absolute. Where
is the scope for sin there? And virtue is only the opposite of
sin.
<!--l. 2000--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We talk of divine virtue.
<!--l. 2002--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>True virtue is divine nature ( swarupa). What you are really is your
virtue. But the opposite of sin which you call virtue is only obedience
born out of fear.
<!--l. 2004--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then why all effort at being good?
<!--l. 2006--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It keeps you on the move. You go on and on till you find God. Then
God takes you into Himself
<!--l. 2008--><p class="noindent" >&#8211; and makes you as He is.
<!--l. 2010--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The same action is considered natural at one point and a sin at
another. What makes it sinful?
<!--l. 2012--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whatever you do against your better knowledge is sin.
<!--l. 2014--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Knowledge depends on memory.
<!--l. 2016--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Remembering your self is virtue, forgetting your self is sin. It all
boils down to the mental or psychological link between the spirit and
matter. We may call the link psyche ( antahkarana). When the psyche
is raw, undeveloped, quite primitive, it is subject to gross illusions. As
it grows in breadth and sensitivity, it becomes a perfect link between
pure matter and pure spirit and gives meaning to matter and
expression to spirit.

<!--l. 2018--><p class="noindent" >There is the material world ( mahadakash) and the spiritual (
paramakash). Between lies the universal mind ( chidakash) which is
also the universal heart ( premakash). It is wise love that makes the
two one.
<!--l. 2020--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Some people are stupid, some are intelligent. The difference
is in their psyche. The ripe ones had more experience behind
them. Just like a child grows by eating and drinking, sleeping and
playing, so is man&#8217;s psyche shaped by all he thinks and feels and
does, until it is perfect enough to serve as a bridge between the
spirit and the body. As a bridge permits the traffic; between
the banks, so does the psyche bring together the source and its
expression.
<!--l. 2022--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Call it love. The bridge is love.
<!--l. 2024--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Ultimately all is experience. Whatever we think, feel, do is
experience. Behind it is the experiencer. So all we know consists of
these two, the experiencer and the experience. But the two are really
one &#8211; the experiencer alone is the experience. Still, the experiencer
takes the experience to be outside. In the same way the spirit and the
body are one; they only appear as two.
<!--l. 2026--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To the Spirit there is no second.
<!--l. 2028--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To whom then does the second appear? It seems to me that duality
is an illusion induced by the imperfection of the psyche. When the
psyche is perfect, duality is no longer seen.
<!--l. 2030--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have said it.
<!--l. 2032--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still I have to repeat my very simple question: who makes the
distinction between sin and virtue?

<!--l. 2034--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He who has a body, sins with the body, he who has a mind, sins
with the mind.
<!--l. 2036--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, the mere possession of mind and body does not compel to
sin. There must be a third factor at the root of it. I come back again
and again to this question of sin and virtue, because nowa-days young
people keep on saying that there is no such thing as sin, that one need
not be squermish and should follow the moment&#8217;s desire readily. They
will accept neither tradition nor authority and can be influenced only
by solid and honest thought. If they refrain from certain actions, it is
through fear of police rather than by conviction. Undoubtedly
there is something in what they say, for we can see how our
values change from place to place and time to time. For instance
&#8211;
<!--l. 2038--><p class="noindent" >killing in war is great virtue today and may be considered a horrible
crime next century.
<!--l. 2040--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A man who moves with the earth will necessarily experience days
and nights. He who stays with the sun will know no darkness. My
world is not yours. As I see it, you all are on a stage performing. There
is no reality about your comings and goings. And your problems are so
unreal!
<!--l. 2042--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We may be sleep-walkers, or subject to nightmares. Is there nothing
you can do?
<!--l. 2044--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am doing: I did enter your dreamlike state to tell you &#8211; &#8221;Stop
hurting yourself and others, stop suffering, wake up&#8221;.
<!--l. 2046--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why then don&#8217;t we wake up?
<!--l. 2048--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Is the practice of Yoga always conscious? Or, can it be
quite unconscious, below the threshold of awareness?
<!--l. 2054--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>In the case of a beginner the practice of Yoga is often
deliberate and requires great determination. But those who are
practising sincerely for many years, are intent on self-realisation all the
time, whether conscious of it or not. Unconscious sadhana is most
effective, because it is spontaneous and steady.
<!--l. 2056--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the position of the man who was a sincere student of
Yoga for some time and then got discouraged and abandoned all
efforts?
<!--l. 2058--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What a man appears to do, or not to do, is often deceptive. His
apparent lethargy may be just a gathering of strength. The causes of
our behaviour are very subtle. One must not be quick to condemn, not
even to praise. Remember that Yoga is the work of the inner self (
vyakta) on the outer self ( vyakti). All that the outer does is merely in
response to the inner.
<!--l. 2060--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still the outer helps.
<!--l. 2062--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How much can it help and in what way? It has some control over
the body and can improve its posture and breathing. Over the mind&#8217;s
thoughts and feelings it has little mastery, for it is itself the mind. It is
the inner that can control the outer. The outer will be wise to
obey.
<!--l. 2064--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If it is the inner that is ultimately responsible for man&#8217;s spiritual
development, why is the outer so much exhorted and encouraged?
<!--l. 2066--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The outer can help by keeping quiet and free from desire and fear.

You would have noticed that all advice to the outer is in the form of
negations: don&#8217;t, stop, refrain, forego, give up, sacrifice, surrender, see
the false as false. Even the little description of reality that is given is
through denials
<!--l. 2068--><p class="noindent" >&#8211; &#8216;not this, not this&#8217;, ( neti, neti). All positives belong to the inner self,
as all absolutes &#8211; to Reality.
<!--l. 2070--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How are we to distinguish the inner from the outer in actual
experience?
<!--l. 2072--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The inner is the source of inspiration, the outer is moved by
memory. The source is untraceable, while all memory begins
somewhere. Thus the outer is always determined, while the inner
cannot be held in words. The mistake of students consists in their
imagining the inner to be something to get hold of, and forgetting that
all perceivables are transient and, therefore, unreal. Only that which
makes perception possible, call it Life or Brahman, or what you like, is
real.
<!--l. 2074--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must Life have a body for its self-expression?
<!--l. 2076--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The body seeks to live. It is not life that needs the body; it is the
body that needs life.
<!--l. 2078--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does life do it deliberately?
<!--l. 2080--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Does love act deliberately? Yes and no. Life is love and love is life.
What keeps the body together but love? What is desire, but love of the
self? What is fear but the urge to protect? And what is knowledge but
the love of truth? The means and forms may be wrong, but the motive
behind is always love &#8211; love of the me and the mine. The me and the
mine may be small, or may explode and embrace the universe, but love
remains.

<!--l. 2082--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The repetition of the name of God is very common in India. Is there
any virtue in it?
<!--l. 2084--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you know the name of a thing, or a person, you can find
it easily. By calling God by His name you make Him come to
you.
<!--l. 2086--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In what shape does He come?
<!--l. 2088--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>According to your expectations. If you happen to be unlucky
and some saintly soul gives you a mantra for good luck and you
repeat it with faith and devotion, your bad luck is bound to
turn.
<!--l. 2090--><p class="noindent" >Steady faith is stronger than destiny. Destiny is the result of causes,
mostly accidental, and is therefore loosely woven. Confidence and good
hope will overcome it easily.
<!--l. 2092--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When a mantra is chanted, what exactly happens?
<!--l. 2094--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The sound of mantra creates the shape which will embody the
Self. The Self can embody any shape &#8211; and operate through it.
After all, the Self is expressing itself in action &#8211; and a mantra
is primarily energy in action. It acts on you, it acts on your
surroundings.
<!--l. 2096--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The mantra is traditional. Must it be so?
<!--l. 2098--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Since time immemorial a link was created between certain
words and corresponding energies and reinforced by numberless
repetitions. It is just like a road to walk on. It is an easy way &#8211;
only faith is needed. You trust the road to take you to your
destination.

<!--l. 2100--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In Europe there is no tradition of a mantra, except in some
contemplative orders. Of what use is it to a modern young Westerner?
<!--l. 2102--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>None, unless he is very much attracted. For him the right
procedure is to adhere to the thought that he is the ground of all
knowledge, the immutable and perennial awareness of all that happens
to the senses and the mind. If he keeps it in mind all the time, aware
and alert, he is bound to break the bounds of non-awareness and
emerge into pure life, light and love. The idea &#8211; &#8216;I am the witness
only&#8217; will purify the body and the mind and open the eye of
wisdom. Then man goes beyond illusion and his heart is free of
all desires. Just like ice turns to water and water to vapour,
and vapour dissolves in air and disappears in space, so does
the body dissolve into pure awareness ( chidakash), then into
pure being ( paramakash), which is beyond all existence and
non-existence.
<!--l. 2104--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The realised man eats, drinks and sleeps. What makes him do
so?
<!--l. 2106--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The same power that moves the universe, moves him too.
<!--l. 2108--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All are moved by the same power: what is the difference?
<!--l. 2110--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This only: The realised man knows what others merely hear; but
don&#8217;t experience. Intellectually they may seem convinced, but in
action they betray their bondage, while the realised man is always
right.
<!--l. 2112--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Everybody says &#8216;I am&#8217;. The realised man too says &#8216;I am&#8217;. Where is
the difference?
<!--l. 2114--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The difference is in the meaning attached to the words &#8216;I am&#8217;. With
the realised man the experience: &#8216;I am the world, the world is mine&#8217; is

supremely valid &#8211; he thinks, feels and acts integrally and in unity with
all that lives. He may not even know the theory and practice of
self-realisation, and be born and bred free of religious and metaphysical
notions. But there will not be the least flaw in his understanding and
compassion.
<!--l. 2116--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I may come across a beggar, naked and hungry and ask him &#8216;Who
are you?&#8217; He may answer: &#8216;I am the Supreme Self&#8217;. &#8216;Well&#8217;, I say, &#8216;suffice
you are the Supreme, change your present state&#8217;. What will he
do?
<!--l. 2118--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He will ask you: &#8216;Which state? What is there that needs changing?
What is wrong with me?
<!--l. 2120--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should he answer so?
<!--l. 2122--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because he is no longer bound by appearances, he does not identify
himself with the name and shape. He uses memory, but memory cannot
use him.
<!--l. 2124--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not all knowledge based on memory?
<!--l. 2126--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Lower knowledge &#8211; yes. Higher knowledge, knowledge of Reality, is
inherent in man&#8217;s true nature.
<!--l. 2128--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can I say that I am not what I am conscious of, nor am I
consciousness itself?
<!--l. 2130--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you are a seeker, better cling to the idea that you are
pure consciousness, free from all content. To go beyond consciousness is
the supreme state.
<!--l. 2132--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The desire for realisation, does it originate in consciousness or
beyond?

<!--l. 2134--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In consciousness, of course. All desire is born from memory and is
within the realm of consciousness. What is beyond is clear of all
striving. The very desire to go beyond consciousness is still in
consciousness.
<!--l. 2136--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there any trace, or imprint, of the beyond on consciousness?
<!--l. 2138--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No, there cannot be.
<!--l. 2140--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then, what is the link between the two? How can a passage be
found between two states which have nothing in common? Is not pure
awareness the link between the two?
<!--l. 2142--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Even pure awareness is a form of consciousness.
<!--l. 2144--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then what is beyond? Emptiness?
<!--l. 2146--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Emptiness again refers only to consciousness. Fullness and
emptiness are relative terms. The Real is really beyond &#8211; beyond not in
relation to consciousness, but beyond all relations of whatever kind.
The difficulty comes with the word &#8216;state&#8217;. The Real is not a state of
something else &#8211;
<!--l. 2148--><p class="noindent" >it is not a state of mind or consciousness or psyche &#8211; nor is it
something that has a beginning and an end, being and not being.
All opposites are contained in it &#8211; but it is not in the play of
opposites.
<!--l. 2150--><p class="noindent" >You must not take it to be the end of a transition. It is itself, after the
consciousness as such is no more. Then words &#8216;I am man&#8217;, or &#8216;I am
God&#8217; have no meaning. Only in silence and in darkness can it be heard
and seen.

<!--l. 2153--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You are all drenched for it is raining hard. In my world it is

there are no desires to slave for.

<!--l. 2157--><p class="noindent" ><span

You can tell me what you like about your world &#8211; I shall listen

your world is not, that you are dreaming.
<!--l. 2159--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 2161--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>My world has no characteristics by which it can be identified. You
can say nothing about it. I am my world. My world is myself. It is
complete and perfect. Every impression is erased, every experience &#8211;
rejected. I need nothing, not even myself, for myself I cannot

<!--l. 2163--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 2165--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All these ideas and distinctions exist in your world; in mine there is
nothing of the kind. My world is single and very simple.

<!--l. 2169--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 2171--><p class="noindent" ><span

inherent in all experience.

<!--l. 2173--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 2193--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 2199--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There are no ruler and ruled here. There is no duality whatsoever.
You are merely projecting your own ideas. Your scriptures and your

<!--l. 2231--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes. The difficulty may be physical, emotional or mental; but it is
always individual. Large scale calamities are the sum of numberless

frog may spend its life in perfect bliss, undistracted, undisturbed.
Outside the rock the world goes on. If the frog in the hole were told
about the outside world, he would say: &#8216;There is no such thing. My
world is of peace and bliss. Your world is a word structure only, it has
no existence&#8217;. It is the same with you. When you tell us that our

world simply does not exist, there is no common ground for
discussion. Or, take another example. I go to a doctor and complain of
stomach ache. He examines me and says: &#8216;You are all right&#8217;.
&#8216;But it pains&#8217; I say. &#8216;Your pain is mental&#8217; he asserts. I say &#8216;It
does not help me to know that my pain is mental. You are a
doctor, cure me of my pain. If you cannot cure me, you are not my
doctor.&#8217;

<!--l. 2255--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Investigate your world, apply your mind to it, examine it critically,
scrutinise every idea about it; that will do.
<!--l. 2257--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The world is too big for investigation. All I know is that I am the
world is, the world troubles me and I trouble the world.
<!--l. 2259--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>My experience is that everything is bliss. But the desire for bliss
creates pain. Thus bliss becomes the seed of pain. The entire universe
of pain is born of desire. Give up the desire for pleasure and you will
not even know what is pain.
<!--l. 2261--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should pleasure be the seed of pain?

<!--l. 2263--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because for the sake of pleasure you are committing many sins.
And the fruits of sin are suffering and death.
<!--l. 2265--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You say the world is of no use to us &#8211; only a tribulation. I feel it
cannot be so. God is not such a fool. The world seems to me a big
enterprise for bringing the potential into actual, matter into life, the
unconscious into full awareness. To realise the supreme we need the
experience of the opposites. Just as for building a temple we need stone
and mortar, wood and iron, glass and tiles, so for making a man
into a divine sage, a master of life and death, one needs the
material of every experience. As a woman goes to the market, buys
provisions of every sort, comes home, cooks, bakes and feeds her
lord, so we bake ourselves nicely in the fire of life and feed our
God.
<!--l. 2267--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Well, if you think so, act on it. Feed your God, by all means.
<!--l. 2269--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A child goes to school and learns many things, which will be of no
use to it later. But in the course of learning it grows. So do we pass
through experiences without number and forget them all, but in the
meantime we grow all the time. And what is a jnani but a man with a
genius for reality!
<!--l. 2271--><p class="noindent" >This world of mine cannot be an accident. It makes sense, there must
be a plan behind it. My God has a plan.

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If the world is false, then the plan and its creator are also
false.
<!--l. 2275--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Again, you deny the world. There is no bridge between us.
<!--l. 2277--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no need of a bridge. Your mistake lies in your belief that
you are born. You were never born nor will you ever die, but you
believe that you were born at a certain date and place and that a

particular body is your own.

<!--l. 2281--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why do you worry about the world before taking care of yourself?
You want to save the world, don&#8217;t you? Can you save the world before
saving yourself? And what means being saved? Saved from what? From
illusion. Salvation is to see things as they are. I really do not see myself
related to anybody and anything. Not even to a self, whatever that self
may be. I remain forever &#8211; undefined. I am &#8211; within and beyond &#8211;
intimate and unapproachable.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How did you come to it?
<!--l. 2285--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By my trust in my Guru. He told me &#8216;You alone are&#8217; and I did not
doubt him. I was merely puzzling over it, until I realised that it is
absolutely true.
<!--l. 2287--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Conviction by repetition?
<!--l. 2289--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By self-realisation. I found that I am conscious and happy absolutely
and only by mistake I thought I owed being- consciousness-bliss to the
body and the world of bodies.
<!--l. 2291--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You are not a learned man. You have not read much and
what you read, or heard did perhaps not contradict itself. I am
fairly well educated and have read a lot and I found that books
and teachers contradict each other hopelessly. Hence whatever
I read or hear, I take it in a state of doubt. &#8216;It may be so, it
may not be so&#8217; is my first reaction. And as my mind is unable
to decide what is true and what is not, I am left high and dry
with my doubts. In Yoga a doubting mind is at a tremendous
disadvantage.

<!--l. 2293--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am glad to hear it; but my Guru too taught me to doubt &#8211;
everything and absolutely. He said: &#8216;deny existence to everything except
your self.&#8217; Through desire you have created the world with its pains
and pleasures.
<!--l. 2296--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must it be also painful?
<!--l. 2298--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else? By its very nature pleasure is limited and transitory.
Out of pain desire is born, in pain it seeks fulfilment, and it ends
in the pain of frustration and despair. Pain is the background
of pleasure, all seeking of pleasure is born in pain and ends in
pain.
<!--l. 2300--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All you say is clear to me. But when some physical or mental
trouble comes, my mind goes dull and grey, or seeks frantically for
relief.
<!--l. 2302--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What does it matter? It is the mind that is dull or restless, not
you. Look, all kinds of things happen in this room. Do I cause them to
happen? They just happen. So it is with you &#8211; the roll of destiny
unfolds itself and actualises the inevitable. You cannot change the
course of events, but you can change your attitude and what
really matters is the attitude and not the bare event. The world
is the abode of desires and fears. You cannot find peace in it.
For peace you must go beyond the world. The root- cause of
the world is self-love. Because of it we seek pleasure and avoid
pain.
<!--l. 2304--><p class="noindent" >Replace self-love by love of the Self and the picture changes. Brahma
the Creator is the sum total of all desires. The world is the instrument
for their fulfilment. Souls take whatever pleasure they desire and pay
for them in tears. Time squares all accounts. The law of balance reigns
supreme.

<!--l. 2306--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To be a superman one must be a man first. Manhood is the fruit of
innumerable experiences: Desire drives to experience. Hence at its own
time and level desire is right.
<!--l. 2308--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All this is true in a way. But a day comes when you have amassed
enough and must begin to build. Then sorting out and discarding (
viveka-vairagya) are absolutely necessary. Everything must be
scrutinised and the unnecessary ruthlessly destroyed. Believe me, there
cannot be too much destruction. For in reality nothing is of value. Be
passionately dispassionate &#8211; that is all.

<h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">Chapter&#x00A0;24</span><br /><a
 id="x1-2900024"></a>God is the All-doer, the Jnani a Non-doer</h2>
<!--l. 2312--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Some Mahatmas (enlightened beings) maintain that the
world is neither an accident nor a play of God, but the result and
expression of a mighty plan of work aiming at awakening and
developing consciousness throughout the universe. From lifelessness to
life, from unconsciousness to consciousness, from dullness to bright
intelligence, from misapprehension to clarity &#8211; that is the direction in
which the world moves ceaselessly and relentlessly. Of course, there are
moments of rest and apparent darkness, when the universe seems to be
dormant, but the rest comes to an end and the work on consciousness
is resumed. From our point of view the world is a dale of tears, a place
to escape from, as soon as possible and by every possible means. To
enlightened beings the world is good and it serves a good purpose.
They do not deny that the world is a mental structure and that
ultimately all is one, but they see and say that the structure has
meaning and serves a supremely desirable purpose. What we
call the will of God is not a capricious whim of a playful deity,
but the expression of an absolute necessity to grow in love and
wisdom and power, to actualise the infinite potentials of life and
consciousness.
<!--l. 2314--><p class="noindent" >Just as a gardener grows flowers from a tiny seed to glorious
perfection, so does God in His own garden grow, among other
beings, men to supermen, who know and love and work along with
Him.
<!--l. 2316--><p class="noindent" >When God takes rest ( pralaya), those whose growth was not
completed, become unconscious for a time, while the perfect ones, who
have gone beyond all forms and contents of consciousness, remain
aware of the universal silence. When the time comes for the emergence
of a new universe, the sleepers wake up and their work starts. The more
advanced wake up first and prepare the ground for the less advanced &#8211;
who thus find forms and patterns of behaviour suitable for their further

growth.
<!--l. 2318--><p class="noindent" >Thus runs the story. The difference with your teaching is this: you
insist that the world is no good and should be shunned. They say that
distaste for the world is a passing stage, necessary, yet temporary, and
is soon replaced by an all-pervading love, and a steady will to work
with God.
<!--l. 2320--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>All you say is right for the outgoing ( pravritti) path. For
the path of return ( nivritti) naughting oneself is necessary. My stand I
take where nothing ( paramakash) is; words do not reach there,
nor thoughts. To the mind it is all darkness and silence. Then
consciousness begins to stir and wakes up the mind ( chidakash),
which projects the world ( mahadakash), built of memory and
imagination. Once the world comes into being, all you say may be
so. It is in the nature of the mind to imagine goals, to strive
towards them, to seek out means and ways, to display vision,
energy and courage. These are divine attributes and I do not deny
them. But I take my stand where no difference exists, where
things are not, nor the minds that create them. There I am at
home.
<!--l. 2322--><p class="noindent" >Whatever happens, does not affect me &#8211; things act on things, that is
all. Free from memory and expectation, I am fresh, innocent and
wholehearted. Mind is the great worker ( mahakarta) and it needs rest.
Needing nothing, I am unafraid. Whom to be afraid of? There is no
separation, we are not separate selves. There is only one Self, the
Supreme Reality, in which the personal and the impersonal are
one.
<!--l. 2324--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All I want is to be able to help the world.
<!--l. 2326--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who says you cannot help? You made up your mind about
what help means and needs and got your self into a conflict

between what you should and what you can, between necessity and
ability.
<!--l. 2328--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But why do we do so?
<!--l. 2330--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your mind projects a structure and you identify yourself with
it. It is in the nature of desire to prompt the mind to create a
world for its fulfilment. Even a small desire can start a long line
of action; what about a strong desire? Desire can produce a
universe; its powers are miraculous. Just as a small matchstick
can set a huge forest on fire, so does a desire light the fires of
manifestation.
<!--l. 2332--><p class="noindent" >The very purpose of creation is the fulfilment of desire. The desire may
be noble, or ignoble, space ( akash) is neutral &#8211; one can fill it with what
one likes: You must be very careful as to what you desire. And as to
the people you want to help, they are in their respective worlds for the
sake of their desires; there is no way of helping them except
through their desires. You can only teach them to have right
desires so that they may rise above them and be free from the
urge to create and recreate worlds of desires, abodes of pain and
pleasure.
<!--l. 2334--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A day must come when the show is wound up; a man must die, a
universe come to an end.
<!--l. 2336--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Just as a sleeping man forgets all and wakes up for another day, or
he dies and emerges into another life, so do the worlds of desire and
fear dissolve and disappear. But the universal witness, the Supreme Self
never sleeps and never dies. Eternally the Great Heart beats and at
each beat a new universe comes into being.
<!--l. 2338--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is he conscious?

<!--l. 2340--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He is beyond all that the mind conceives. He is beyond being and
not being. He is the Yes and No to everything, beyond and within,
creating and destroying, unimaginably real.
<!--l. 2342--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>God and the Mahatma are they one or two?
<!--l. 2344--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They are one.
<!--l. 2346--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There must be some difference.
<!--l. 2348--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>God is the All-Doer, the jnani is a non-doer. God himself does not
say: &#8216;I am doing all.&#8217; To Him things happen by their own nature. To
the jnani all is done by God. He sees no difference between God and
nature. Both God and the jnani know themselves to be the immovable
centre of the movable, the eternal witness of the transient. The centre
is a point of void and the witness a point of pure awareness; they
know themselves to be as nothing, therefore nothing can resist
them.
<!--l. 2350--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does this look and feel in your personal experience?
<!--l. 2352--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Being nothing, I am all. Everything is me, everything is mine. Just
as my body moves by my mere thinking of the movement, so do things
happen as I think of them. Mind you, I do nothing. I just see them
happen.
<!--l. 2354--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do things happen as you want them to happen, or do you want
them to happen as they happen?
<!--l. 2356--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Both. I accept and am accepted. I am all and all is me. Being the
world I am not afraid of the world. Being all, what am I to be afraid
of? Water is not afraid of water, nor fire of fire. Also I am not afraid
because I am nothing that can experience fear, or can be in
danger. I have no shape, nor name. It is attachment to a name

and shape that breeds fear. I am not attached. I am nothing,
and nothing is afraid of no thing. On the contrary, everything
is afraid of the Nothing, for when a thing touches Nothing, it
becomes nothing. It is like a bottomless well, whatever falls into it,
disappears.
<!--l. 2358--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Isn&#8217;t God a person?
<!--l. 2360--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you think yourself to be a person, He too is a person.
When you are all, you see Him as all.
<!--l. 2362--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can I change facts by changing attitude?
<!--l. 2364--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The attitude is the fact. Take anger. I may be furious, pacing the
room up and down; at the same time I know what I am, a centre of
wisdom and love, an atom of pure existence. All subsides and the mind
merges into silence.
<!--l. 2366--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still, you are angry sometimes.
<!--l. 2368--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>With whom am l to be angry and for what? Anger came and
dissolved on my remembering myself. It is all a play of gunas (qualities
of cosmic matter). When I identify myself with them, I am their slave.
When I stand apart, I am their master.
<!--l. 2370--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can you influence the world by your attitude? By separating
yourself from the world you lose all hope of helping it.
<!--l. 2372--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can it be? All is myself &#8211; can&#8217;t I help myself? I do not identify
myself with anybody in particular, for I am all &#8211; both the particular
and the universal.
<!--l. 2374--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can you then help me, the particular person?

<!--l. 2376--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But I do help you always &#8211; from within. My self and your self are
one. I know it, but you don&#8217;t.
<!--l. 2378--><p class="noindent" >That is all the difference &#8211; and it cannot last.
<!--l. 2380--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And how do you help the entire world?
<!--l. 2382--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Gandhi is dead, yet his mind pervades the earth. The thought of a
jnani pervades humanity and works ceaselessly for good. Being
anonymous, coming from within, it is the more powerful and
compelling. That is how the world improves &#8211; the inner aiding and
blessing the outer. When a jnani dies, he is no more, in the same sense
in which a river is no more when it merges in the sea, the name, the
shape, are no more, but the water remains and becomes one with the
ocean. When a jnani joins the universal mind, all his goodness and
wisdom become the heritage of humanity and uplift every human
being.
<!--l. 2384--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are attached to our personality. Our individuality, our being
unlike others, we value very much. You seem to denounce both as
useless. Your unmanifested, of what use is it to us?
<!--l. 2386--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Unmanifested, manifested, individuality, personality ( nirguna,
saguna, vyakta, vyakti); all these are mere words, points of view,
mental attitudes. There is no reality in them. The real is experienced in
silence. You cling to personality &#8211; but you are conscious of being a
person only when you are in trouble &#8211; when you are not in trouble you
do not think of yourself.
<!--l. 2388--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You did not tell me the uses of the Unmanifested.
<!--l. 2390--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Surely, you must sleep in order to wake up. You must die in
order to live, you must melt down to shape anew. You must
destroy to build, annihilate before creation. The Supreme is the

universal solvent, it corrodes every container, it burns through
every obstacle. Without the absolute denial of everything the
tyranny of things would be absolute. The Supreme is the great
harmoniser, the guarantee of the ultimate and perfect balance &#8211; of
life in freedom. It dissolves you and thus reasserts your true
being.
<!--l. 2392--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is all well on its own level. But how does it work in daily
life?
<!--l. 2394--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The daily life is a life of action. Whether you like it or not, you
must function. Whatever you do for your own sake accumulates and
becomes explosive; one day it goes off and plays havoc with you and
your world. When you deceive yourself that you work for the good of
all, it makes matters worse, for you should not be guided by your own
ideas of what is good for others. A man who claims to know what is
good for others, is dangerous.
<!--l. 2396--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is one to work then?
<!--l. 2398--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither for yourself nor for others, but for the work&#8217;s own sake. A
thing worth doing is its own purpose and meaning, Make nothing a
means to something else. Bind not. God does not create one thing to
serve another. Each is made for its own sake. Because it is made for
itself, it does not interfere. You are using things and people for
purposes alien to them and you play havoc with the world and
yourself.
<!--l. 2400--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Our real being is all the time with us, you say. How is it that we do
not notice it?
<!--l. 2402--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, you are always the Supreme. But your attention is fixed on
things, physical or mental.

<!--l. 2404--><p class="noindent" >When your attention is off a thing and not yet fixed on another, in the
interval you are pure being.
<!--l. 2406--><p class="noindent" >When through the practice of discrimination and detachment (
viveka-vairagya), you lose sight of sensory and mental states, pure
being emerges as the natural state.
<!--l. 2408--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one bring to an end this sense of separateness?
<!--l. 2410--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By focussing the mind on &#8216;I am&#8217;, on the sense of being, &#8216;I am
so-and-so&#8217; dissolves; &#8221;I am a witness only&#8221; remains and that too
submerges in &#8216;I am all&#8217;. Then the all becomes the One and the One &#8211;
yourself, not to be separate from me. Abandon the idea of a
separate &#8216;I&#8217; and the question of &#8216;whose experience?&#8217; will not
arise.
<!--l. 2413--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You speak from your own experience. How can I make it
mine?
<!--l. 2415--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You speak of my experience as different from your experience,
because you believe we are separate. But we are not. On a deeper
level my experience is your experience. Dive deep within yourself
and you will find it easily and simply. Go in the direction of &#8216;I
am&#8217;.

<!--l. 2419--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Are you ever glad or sad? Do you know joy and
sorrow?
<!--l. 2421--><p class="noindent" ><span

and I am not the mind.
<!--l. 2423--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is love a state of mind?
<!--l. 2425--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again, it depends what you mean by love. Desire is, of course, a
state of mind. But the realisation of unity is beyond mind. To
me, nothing exists by itself. All is the Self, all is myself. To see
myself in everybody and everybody in myself most certainly is
love.
<!--l. 2427--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I see something pleasant, I want it. Who exactly wants it?
The self or the mind?
<!--l. 2429--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The question is wrongly put. There is no &#8216;who&#8217;. There is desire,
fear, anger, and the mind says &#8211;
<!--l. 2431--><p class="noindent" >this is me, this is mine. There is no thing which could be called &#8216;me&#8217; or
&#8216;mine&#8217;. Desire is a state of the mind, perceived and named by
the mind. Without the mind perceiving and naming, where is
desire?
<!--l. 2433--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But is there such a thing as perceiving without naming?
<!--l. 2435--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. Naming cannot go beyond the mind, while perceiving is
consciousness itself.
<!--l. 2437--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When somebody dies what exactly happens?

<!--l. 2439--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing happens. Something becomes nothing. Nothing was,
nothing remains.
<!--l. 2441--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely there is a difference between the living and the dead. You
speak of the living as dead and of the dead as living.
<!--l. 2443--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why do you fret at one man dying and care little for the millions
dying every day? Entire universes are imploding and exploding every
moment &#8211; am I to cry over them? One thing is quite clear to me: all
that is, lives and moves and has its being in consciousness and I am in
and beyond that consciousness. I am in it as the witness. I am beyond
it as Being.
<!--l. 2445--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, you care when your child is ill, don&#8217;t you?
<!--l. 2447--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I don&#8217;t get flustered. I just do the needful. I do not worry about the
future. A right response to every situation is in my nature. I do not
stop to think what to do. I act and move on. Results do not affect me. I
do not even care, whether they are good or bad. Whatever they are,
they are &#8211; if they come back to me, I deal with them afresh. Or,
rather, I happen to deal with them afresh. There is no sense of
purpose in my doing anything. Things happens as they happen &#8211;
not because I make them happen, but it is because I am that
they happen. In reality nothing ever happens. When the mind is
restless, it makes Shiva dance, like the restless waters of the
lake make the moon dance. It is all appearance, due to wrong
ideas.
<!--l. 2449--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, you are aware of many things and behave according to
their nature. You treat a child as a child and an adult as an
adult.
<!--l. 2451--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Just as the taste of salt pervades the great ocean and every single
drop of sea-water carries the same flavour, so every experience gives

me the touch of reality, the ever fresh realisation of my own
being.
<!--l. 2453--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do I exist in your world, as you exist in mine?
<!--l. 2455--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course, you are and I am. But only as points in consciousness;
we are nothing apart from consciousness. This must be well grasped:
the world hangs on the thread of consciousness; no consciousness, no
world.
<!--l. 2457--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There are many points in consciousness; are there as many
worlds?
<!--l. 2459--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Take dream for an example. In a hospital there may be many
patients, all sleeping, all dreaming, each dreaming his own private,
personal dreams unrelated, unaffected, having one single factor in
common &#8211; illness. Similarly, we have divorced ourselves in our
imagination from the real world of common experience and enclosed
ourselves in a cloud of personal desire and fears, images and thoughts,
ideas and concepts.
<!--l. 2461--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This I can understand. But what could be the cause of the
tremendous variety of the personal worlds?
<!--l. 2463--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The variety is not so great. All the dreams are superimposed over a
common world. To some extent they shape and influence each other.
The basic unity operates in spite of all. At the root of it all lies
self-forgetfulness; not knowing who I am.
<!--l. 2465--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To forget, one must know. Did I know who I am, before I forgot
it?
<!--l. 2467--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. Self-forgetting is inherent in self-knowing. Consciousness
and unconsciousness are two aspects of one life. They co-exist. To

know the world you forget the self &#8211; to know the self you forget
the world. What is world after all? A collection of memories.
Cling to one thing, that matters, hold on to &#8216;I am&#8217; and let go
all else. This is sadhana. In realisation there is nothing to hold
on to and nothing to forget. Everything is known, nothing is
remembered.
<!--l. 2469--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the cause of self-forgetting?
<!--l. 2471--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no cause, because there is no forgetting. Mental
states succeed one another, and each obliterates the previous
one. Self-remembering is a mental state and self-forgetting is
another. They alternate like day and night. Reality is beyond
both.
<!--l. 2473--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely there must be a difference between forgetting and not
knowing. Not knowing needs no cause. Forgetting presupposes previous
knowledge and also the tendency or ability to forget. I admit I cannot
enquire into the reason for not-knowing, but forgetting must have some
ground.
<!--l. 2475--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no such thing as not-knowing. There is only forgetting.
What is wrong with forgetting? It is as simple to forget as to
remember.
<!--l. 2477--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it not a calamity to forget oneself?
<!--l. 2479--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As bad as to remember oneself continuously. There is a state
beyond forgetting and not-forgetting &#8211; the natural state. To remember,
to forget &#8211; these are all states of mind, thought-bound, word-bound.
Take for example, the idea of being born. I am told I was born. I do not
remember. I am told I shall die I do not expect it. You tell me I have
forgotten, or I lack imagination. But I just cannot remember what
never happened, nor expect the patently impossible. Bodies are born

and bodies die, but what is it to me? Bodies come and go in
consciousness and consciousness itself has its roots in me. I am life and
mine are mind and body.
<!--l. 2481--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You say at the root of the world is self-forgetfulness. To forget I
must remember What did I forget to remember? I have not forgotten
that I am.
<!--l. 2483--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This &#8216;I am&#8217; too may be a part of the illusion.
<!--l. 2485--><p class="noindent" >Q. How can it be? You cannot prove to me that I am not. Even when
convinced that I am not &#8211; I am.
<!--l. 2487--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Reality can neither be proved nor disproved. Within the mind you
cannot, beyond the mind you need not. In the real, the question &#8216;what
is real?&#8217; does not arise. The manifested ( saguna) and unmanifested (
nirguna) are not different.
<!--l. 2489--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In that case all is real.
<!--l. 2491--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am all. As myself all is real. Apart from me, nothing is
real.
<!--l. 2493--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do not feel that the world is the result of a mistake.
<!--l. 2495--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You may say so only after a full investigation, not before. Of
course, when you discern and let go all that is unreal, what remains is
real.
<!--l. 2497--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does anything remain?
<!--l. 2499--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The real remains. But don&#8217;t be mislead by words!
<!--l. 2501--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Since immemorial time, during innumerable births, I build and

improve and beautify my world. It is neither perfect, nor unreal. It is a
process.
<!--l. 2503--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are mistaken. The world has no existence apart from you. At
every moment it is but a reflection of yourself. You create it, you
destroy it.
<!--l. 2505--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And build it again, improved.
<!--l. 2507--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To improve it, you must disprove it. One must die to live. There is
no rebirth, except through death.
<!--l. 2509--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Your universe may be perfect. My personal universe is improving.
<!--l. 2511--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your personal universe does not exist by itself. It is merely a
limited and distorted view of the real. It is not the universe that needs
improving, but your way of looking.
<!--l. 2513--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do you view it?
<!--l. 2515--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is a stage on which a world drama is being played. The quality of
the performance is all that matters; not what the actors say and do,
but how they say and do it.
<!--l. 2517--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do not like this lila (play) idea I would rather compare the world
to a work-yard in which we are the builders.
<!--l. 2519--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You take it too seriously. What is wrong with play? You have a
purpose only as long as you are not complete ( purna); till then
completeness, perfection, is the purpose. But when you are complete in
yourself, fully integrated within and without, then you enjoy the
universe; you do not labour at it.
<!--l. 2521--><p class="noindent" >To the disintegrated you may seem working hard, but that is their

illusion. Sportsmen seem to make tremendous efforts: yet their sole
motive is to play and display.
<!--l. 2523--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you mean to say that God is just having fun, that he is engaged
in purposeless action?
<!--l. 2525--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>God is not only true and good, he is also beautiful (
satyam-shivam-sundaram). He creates beauty &#8211; for the joy of
It
<!--l. 2527--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Well, then beauty is his purpose!
<!--l. 2529--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why do you introduce purpose? Purpose implies movement,
change, a sense of imperfection.
<!--l. 2531--><p class="noindent" >God does not aim at beauty &#8211; whatever he does is beautiful. Would
you say that a flower is trying to be beautiful? It is beautiful by its
very nature. Similarly God is perfection itself, not an effort at
perfection.
<!--l. 2533--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The purpose fulfils itself in beauty.
<!--l. 2535--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is beautiful? Whatever is perceived blissfully is beautiful.
Bliss is the essence of beauty.
<!--l. 2537--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You speak of Sat-Chit-Ananda. That I am is obvious. That I know
is obvious. That I am happy is not at all obvious. Where has my
happiness gone?
<!--l. 2539--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Be fully aware of your own being and you will be in bliss
consciously. Because you take your mind off yourself and make it dwell
on what you are not, you lose your sense of well-being of being
well.

<!--l. 2541--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There are two paths before us &#8211; the path of effort ( yoga marga),
and the path of ease ( bhoga marga). Both lead to the same goal &#8211;
liberation.
<!--l. 2543--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why do you call bhoga a path? How can ease bring you
perfection?
<!--l. 2545--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The perfect renouncer ( yogi) will find reality. The perfect enjoyer (
bhogi) also will come to it.
<!--l. 2547--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can it be? Aren&#8217;t they contradictory?
<!--l. 2549--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The extremes meet. To be a perfect Bhogi is more difficult than to
be a perfect Yogi. I am a humble man and cannot venture judgements
of value. Both the Yogi and the Bhogi, after all, are concerned with the
search for happiness. The Yogi wants it permanent, the Bhogi is
satisfied with the intermittent. Often the Bhogi strives harder than the
Yogi.
<!--l. 2551--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is your happiness worth when you have to strive and labour
for it? True happiness is spontaneous and effortless.
<!--l. 2553--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All beings seek happiness. The means only differ. Some seek it
within and are therefore called Yogis; some seek it without and are
condemned as Bhogis. Yet they need each other.
<!--l. 2555--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pleasure and pain alternate. Happiness is unshakable. What you
can seek and find is not the real thing. Find what you have never lost,
find the inalienable.

 id="x1-3100026"></a>Personality, an Obstacle</h2>
<!--l. 2559--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>As I can see, the world is a school of Yoga and life itself is
Yoga practice. Everybody strives for perfection and what is Yoga but
striving. There is nothing contemptible about the so-called &#8216;common&#8217;
people and their &#8216;common&#8217; lives. They strive as hard and suffer
as much as the Yogi, only they are not conscious of their true
purpose.
<!--l. 2561--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>In what way are your common people &#8211; Yogis?
<!--l. 2563--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Their ultimate goal is the same. What the Yogi secures by
renunciation ( tyaga) the common man realises through experience (
bhoga). The way of Bhoga is unconscious and, therefore, repetitive and
protracted, while the way of Yoga is deliberate and intense and,
therefore, can be more rapid.
<!--l. 2565--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe the periods of Yoga and Bhoga alternate. First Bhogi, then
Yogi, then again Bhogi, then again Yogi.
<!--l. 2567--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What may be the purpose?
<!--l. 2569--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Weak desires can be removed by introspection and meditation, but
strong, deep-rooted ones must be fulfilled and their fruits, sweet or
bitter, tasted.
<!--l. 2571--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why then should we pay tribute to Yogis and speak slightingly of
Bhogis? All are Yogis, in a way.
<!--l. 2573--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On the human scale of values deliberate effort is considered
praiseworthy. In reality both the Yogi and Bhogi follow their own
nature, according to circumstances and opportunities. The Yogi&#8217;s life is
governed by a single desire &#8211; to find the Truth; the Bhogi serves
many masters. But the Bhogi becomes a Yogi and the Yogi may

get a rounding up in a bout of Bhoga. The final result is the
same.
<!--l. 2575--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Buddha is reported to have said that it is tremendously important
to have heard that there is enlightenment, a complete reversal and
transformation in consciousness. The good news is compared to a spark
in a shipload of cotton; slowly but relentlessly the whole of it will turn
to ashes.
<!--l. 2577--><p class="noindent" >Similarly the good news of enlightenment will, sooner or later, bring
about a transformation.
<!--l. 2579--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, first hearing ( shravana), then remembering ( smarana),
pondering ( manana) and so on. We are on familiar ground. The man
who heard the news becomes a Yogi; while the rest continue in their
Bhoga.
<!--l. 2581--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But you agree that living a life &#8211; just living the humdrum life of the
world, being born to die and dying to be born &#8211; advances man by its
sheer volume, just like the river finds its way to the sea by the sheer
mass of the water it gathers.
<!--l. 2583--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Before the world was, consciousness was. In consciousness it comes
into being, in consciousness it lasts and into pure consciousness it
dissolves. At the root of everything, is the feeling &#8216;I am&#8217;. The state of
mind: &#8216;there is a world&#8217; is secondary, for to be, I do not need the world,
the world needs me.
<!--l. 2585--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The desire to live is a tremendous thing.
<!--l. 2587--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Still greater is the freedom from the urge to live.
<!--l. 2589--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The freedom of the stone?

<!--l. 2591--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, the freedom of the stone, and much more besides. Freedom
unlimited and conscious.
<!--l. 2593--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not personality required for gathering experience?
<!--l. 2595--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As you are now, the personality is only an obstacle. Self-identification
with the body may be good for an infant, but true growing up depends
on getting the body out of the way. Normally, one should outgrow
body-based desires early in life. Even the Bhogi, who does not
refuse enjoyments, need not hanker after the ones he has tasted.
Habit, desire for repetition frustrates both the Yogi and the
Bhogi.
<!--l. 2597--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why do you keep on dismissing the person ( vyakti) as of no
importance? Personality is the primary fact of our existence. It
occupies the entire stage.
<!--l. 2599--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you do not see that it is mere habit, built on
memory, prompted by desire, you will think yourself to be a person
&#8211; living, feeling, thinking, active, passive, pleased or pained.
Question yourself, ask yourself. &#8216;Is it so?&#8217; &#8216;Who am l&#8217;? &#8216;What is
behind and beyond all this?&#8217; And soon you will see your mistake.
And it is in the very nature of a mistake to cease to be, when
seen.
<!--l. 2601--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The Yoga of living, of life itself, we may call the Natural Yoga (
nisarga yoga). It reminds me of the Primal Yoga ( adhi yoga),
mentioned in the Rig-Veda which was described as the marrying of life
with mind.
<!--l. 2603--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A life lived thoughtfully, in full awareness, is by itself Nisarga
Yoga.
<!--l. 2605--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What does the marriage of life and mind mean?

<!--l. 2607--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Living in spontaneous awareness, consciousness of effortless living,
being fully interested in one&#8217;s life &#8211; all this is implied.
<!--l. 2609--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sharada Devi, wife of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, used to scold
his disciples for too much effort. She compared them to mangoes on
the tree which are being plucked before they are ripe. &#8216;Why
hurry?&#8217; she used to say. &#8216;Wait till you are fully ripe, mellow and
sweet.&#8217;
<!--l. 2612--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How right she was! There are so many who take the dawn for the
noon, a momentary experience for full realisation and destroy even the
little they gain by excess of pride. Humility and silence are essential for
a sadhaka, however advanced. Only a fully ripened jnani can allow
himself complete spontaneity.
<!--l. 2614--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It seems there are schools of Yoga where the student, after
illumination, is obliged to keep silent for 7 or 12 or 15 or even 25 years.
Even Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi imposed on himself 20 years of
silence before he began to teach.
<!--l. 2616--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, the inner fruit must ripen. Until then the discipline, the living
in awareness, must go on.
<!--l. 2618--><p class="noindent" >Gradually the practice becomes more and more subtle, until it becomes
altogether formless.
<!--l. 2620--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Krishnamurti too speaks of living in awareness.
<!--l. 2622--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He always aims directly at the &#8216;ultimate&#8217;. Yes, ultimately all Yogas
end in your adhi yoga, the marriage of consciousness (the bride) to life
(the bridegroom). Consciousness and being ( sad-chit) meet in bliss (
ananda). For bliss to arise there must be meeting, contact, the assertion
of unity in duality.

<!--l. 2624--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Buddha too has said that for the attainment of nirvana one must go
to living beings.
<!--l. 2626--><p class="noindent" >Consciousness needs life to grow.
<!--l. 2628--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world itself is contact &#8211; the totality of all contacts actualised in
consciousness. The spirit touches matter and consciousness results.
Such consciousness. when tainted with memory and expectation,
becomes bondage. Pure experience does not bind; experience caught
between desire and fear is impure and creates karma.
<!--l. 2630--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can there be happiness in unity? Does not all happiness imply
necessarily contact, hence duality?
<!--l. 2632--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is nothing wrong with duality as long as it does not create
conflict. Multiplicity and variety without strife is joy. In pure
consciousness there is light. For warmth, contact is needed. Above the
unity of being is the union of love. Love is the meaning and purpose of
duality.
<!--l. 2634--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am an adopted child. My own father I do not know. My mother
died when I was born. My foster father, to please my foster mother,
who was childless, adopted me &#8211; almost by accident. He is a
simple man &#8211; a truck owner and driver. My mother keeps the
house. I am 24 years now. For the last two and a half years I am
travelling, restless, seeking. I want to live a good life, a holy
life.
<!--l. 2636--><p class="noindent" >What am I to do?
<!--l. 2638--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Go home, take charge of your father&#8217;s business, look after your
parents in their old age. Marry the girl who is waiting for you, be loyal,
be simple, be humble. Hide your virtue, live silently. The five senses
and the three qualities ( gunas) are your eight steps in Yoga. And &#8216;I

am&#8217; is the Great Reminder ( mahamantra). You can learn from them
all you need to know. Be attentive, enquire ceaselessly. That is
all.
<!--l. 2640--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If just living one&#8217;s life liberates, why are not all liberated?
<!--l. 2642--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All are being liberated. It is not what you live, but how you live
that matters. The idea of enlightenment is of utmost importance.
Just to know that there is such possibility, changes one&#8217;s entire
outlook. It acts like a burning match in a heap of saw dust. All the
great teachers did nothing else. A spark of truth can burn up a
mountain of lies. The opposite is also true; The sun of truth
remains hidden behind the cloud of self-identification with the
body.
<!--l. 2644--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This spreading the good news of enlightenment seems very
important.
<!--l. 2646--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The very hearing of it, is a promise of enlightenment. The very
meeting a Guru is the assurance of liberation. Perfection is life-giving
and creative.
<!--l. 2648--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does a realised man ever think: &#8216;I am realised?&#8217; Is he not astonished
when people make much of him? Does he not take himself to be an
ordinary human being?
<!--l. 2650--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither ordinary, nor extra-ordinary. Just being aware and
affectionate &#8211; intensely. He looks at himself without indulging in
self-definitions and self-identifications. He does not know himself as
anything apart from the world. He is the world. He is completely rid of
himself, like a man who is very rich, but continually gives away
his riches. He is not rich, for he has nothing; he is not poor,
for he gives abundantly. He is just propertyless. Similarly, the
realised man is egoless; he has lost the capacity of identifying

himself with anything. He is without location, placeless, beyond
space and time, beyond the world. Beyond words and thoughts is
he.
<!--l. 2652--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Well, it is deep mystery to me. I am a simple man.
<!--l. 2654--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is you who are deeply complex, mysterious, hard to understand. I
am simplicity itself, compared to you: I am what is &#8211; without any
distinction whatsoever into inner and outer, mine and yours,
good and bad. What the world is, I am; what I am the world
is.
<!--l. 2656--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does it happen that each man creates his own world?
<!--l. 2658--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When a number of people are asleep, each dreams his own dream.
Only on awakening the question of many different dreams arises
and dissolves when they are all seen as dreams, as something
imagined.
<!--l. 2660--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even dreams have a foundation.
<!--l. 2662--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In memory. Even then, what is remembered, is but another dream.
The memory of the false cannot but give rise to the false. There is
nothing wrong with memory as such. What is false is its content.
Remember facts, forget opinions.

<!--l. 2669--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>The other day I was asking you about the two ways of
growth &#8211; renunciation and enjoyment ( yoga and bhoga). The difference
is not so great as it looks &#8211; the Yogi renounces to enjoy; the Bhogi
enjoys to renounce. The Yogi renounces first.
<!--l. 2671--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>So what? Leave the Yogi to his Yoga and the Bhogi to
Bhoga.
<!--l. 2673--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The way of Bhoga seems to me the better one. The Yogi is like a
green mango, separated from the tree prematurely and kept to open
in a basket of straw. Airless and overheated, it does get ripe,
but the true flavour and fragrance are lost. The mango left on
the tree grows to full size, colour and sweetness. A joy in every
way. Yet somehow Yoga gets all the praises, and Bhoga &#8211; all the
curses.
<!--l. 2675--><p class="noindent" >As I see it, Bhoga is the better of the two.
<!--l. 2677--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What makes you say so?
<!--l. 2679--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I watched the Yogis and their enormous efforts. Even when they
realise, there is something bitter or astringent about it. They
seem to spend much of their time in trances and when they
speak, they merely voice their scriptures. At their best such jnanis
are like flowers &#8211; perfect, but just little flowers, shedding their
fragrance within a short radius. There are some others, who are like
forests
<!--l. 2681--><p class="noindent" >&#8211; rich, varied, immense, full of surprises, a world in themselves. There
must be a reason for this difference.
<!--l. 2683--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Well, you said it. According to you one got stunted in his Yoga,

while the other flourished in Bhoga.
<!--l. 2685--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it not so? The Yogi is afraid of life and seeks peace, while the
Bhogi is adventurous, full of spirits, forward going. The Yogi is bound
by an ideal, while the Bhogi is ever ready to explore.
<!--l. 2687--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is a matter of wanting much or being satisfied with little. The
Yogi is ambitious while the Bhogi is merely adventurous. Your
Bhogi seems to be richer and more interesting, but it is not so in
reality.
<!--l. 2689--><p class="noindent" >The Yogi is narrow as the sharp edge of the knife. He has to be &#8211; to cut
deep and smoothly, to penetrate unerringly the many layers of the
false. The Bhogi worships at many altars; the Yogi serves none but his
own true Self.
<!--l. 2691--><p class="noindent" >There is no purpose in opposing the Yogi to the Bhogi. The way of
outgoing ( pravritti) necessarily precedes the way of returning (
nivritti). To sit in judgement and allot marks is ridiculous. Everything
contributes to the ultimate perfection. Some say there are three aspects
of reality &#8211; Truth-Wisdom-Bliss; He who seeks Truth becomes a Yogi,
he who seeks wisdom becomes a jnani; he who seeks happiness becomes
the man of action.
<!--l. 2693--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are told of the bliss of non-duality.
<!--l. 2695--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Such bliss is more of the nature of a great peace. Pleasure and pain
are the fruits of actions &#8211;
<!--l. 2697--><p class="noindent" >righteous and unrighteous.
<!--l. 2699--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What makes the difference?
<!--l. 2701--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The difference is between giving and grasping. Whatever the way of

approach, in the end all becomes one.
<!--l. 2703--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If there be no difference in the goal, why discriminate between
various approaches?
<!--l. 2705--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Let each act according to his nature. The ultimate purpose will be
served in any case. All your discriminations and classifications are quite
all right, but they do not exist in my case. As the description of a
dream may be detailed and accurate, though without having any
foundation, so does your pattern fit nothing but your own assumptions.
You begin with an idea and you end with the same idea under a
different garb.
<!--l. 2707--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do you see things?
<!--l. 2709--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>One and all are the same to me. The same consciousness ( chit)
appears as being ( sat) and as bliss ( ananda): Chit in movement is
Ananda; Chit motionless is being.
<!--l. 2711--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still you are making a distinction between motion and
motionlessness.
<!--l. 2713--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Non-distinction speaks in silence. Words carry distinctions. The
unmanifested ( nirguna) has no name, all names refer to the manifested
( saguna). It is useless to struggle with words to express what is
beyond words. Consciousness ( chidananda) is spirit ( purusha),
consciousness is matter ( prakriti). Imperfect spirit is matter,
perfect matter is spirit. In the beginning as in the end, all is
one.
<!--l. 2715--><p class="noindent" >All division is in the mind ( chitta); there is none in reality ( chit).
Movement and rest are states of mind and cannot be without their
opposites. By itself nothing moves, nothing rests. It is a grievous
mistake to attribute to mental constructs absolute existence. Nothing

exists by itself.
<!--l. 2717--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You seem to identify rest with the Supreme State?
<!--l. 2719--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is rest as a state of mind ( chidaram) and there is rest as a
state of being ( atmaram). The former comes and goes, while the true
rest is the very heart of action. Unfortunately, language is a mental tool
and works only in opposites.
<!--l. 2721--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As a witness, you are working or at rest?
<!--l. 2723--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Witnessing is an experience and rest is freedom from experience.
<!--l. 2725--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can&#8217;t they co-exist, as the tumult of the waves and the quiet of the
deep co-exist in the ocean.
<!--l. 2727--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Beyond the mind there is no such thing as experience. Experience
is a dual state. You cannot talk of reality as an experience. Once this is
understood, you will no longer look for being and becoming as
separate and opposite. In reality they are one and inseparable, like
roots and branches of the same tree. Both can exist only in the
light of consciousness, which again, arises in the wake of the
sense &#8216;I am&#8217;. This is the primary fact. If you miss it, you miss
all.
<!--l. 2729--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is the sense of being a product of experience only? The great saying
( Mahavakya) tat-sat is it a mere mode of mentation?
<!--l. 2731--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whatever is spoken is speech only. Whatever is thought is thought
only. The real meaning is unexplainable, though experienceable. The
Mahavakya is true, but your ideas are false, for all ideas ( kalpana) are
false.
<!--l. 2733--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is the conviction: &#8216;I am That&#8217; false?

<!--l. 2735--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. Conviction is a mental state. In &#8216;That&#8217; there is no &#8216;I am&#8217;.
With the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;
<!--l. 2737--><p class="noindent" >emerging, &#8216;That&#8217; is obscured, as with the sun rising the stars are wiped
out. But as with the sun comes light, so with the sense of self comes
bliss ( chidananda). The cause of bliss is sought in the &#8216;not&#8211;I&#8217; and thus
the bondage begins.
<!--l. 2740--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In your daily life are you always conscious of your real state?
<!--l. 2742--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither conscious, nor unconscious. I do not need convictions. I live
on courage. Courage is my essence, which is love of life. I am free of
memories and anticipations, unconcerned with what I am and what I
am not. I am not addicted to self-descriptions, soham and brahmasmi
(&#8217;I am He&#8217;, &#8216;I am the Supreme&#8217;) are of no use to me, I have the courage
to be as nothing and to see the world as it is: nothing. It sounds simple,
just try it!
<!--l. 2744--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But what gives you courage?
<!--l. 2746--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How perverted are your views! Need courage be given? Your
question implies that anxiety is the normal state and courage is
abnormal. It is the other way round. Anxiety and hope are born of
imagination &#8211; I am free of both. I am simple being and I need nothing
to rest on.
<!--l. 2748--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Unless you know yourself, of what use is your being to you? To be
happy with what you are, you must know what you are.
<!--l. 2750--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Being shines as knowing, knowing is warm in love. It is all one. You
imagine separations and trouble yourself with questions. Don&#8217;t
concern yourself overmuch with formulations. Pure being cannot be
described.

<!--l. 2752--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Unless a thing is knowable and enjoyable, it is of no use to me. It
must become a part of my experience, first of all.
<!--l. 2754--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are dragging down reality to the level of experience. How can
reality depend on experience, when it is the very ground ( adhar) of
experience. Reality is in the very fact of experience, not in its nature.
Experience is, after all, a state of mind, while being is definitely not a
state of mind.
<!--l. 2756--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Again I am confused! Is being separate from knowing?
<!--l. 2758--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The separation is an appearance. Just as the dream is not apart
from the dreamer, so is knowing not apart from being. The dream is
the dreamer, the knowledge is the knower, the distinction is merely
verbal.
<!--l. 2760--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can see now that sat and chit are one. But what about bliss (
ananda)? Being and consciousness are always present together, but
bliss flashes only occasionally.
<!--l. 2762--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The undisturbed state of being is bliss; the disturbed state is what
appears as the world. In non-duality there is bliss; in duality &#8211;
experience. What comes and goes is experience with its duality of pain
and pleasure. Bliss is not to be known. One is always bliss, but never
blissful. Bliss is not an attribute.
<!--l. 2764--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have another question to ask: Some Yogis attain their goal, but it
is of no use to others. They do not know, or are not able to share.
Those who can share out what they have, initiate others.
<!--l. 2766--><p class="noindent" >Where lies the difference?
<!--l. 2768--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no difference. Your approach is wrong. There are no others
to help. A rich man, when he hands over his entire fortune to his

family, has not a coin left to give a beggar. So is the wise man ( jnani)
stripped of all his powers and possessions. Nothing, literally
nothing, can be said about him. He cannot help anybody for he is
everybody. He is the poor and also his poverty, the thief and also his
thievery. How can he be said to help, when he is not apart? Who
thinks of himself as separate from the world, let him help the
world.
<!--l. 2770--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still, there is duality, there is sorrow, there is need of help. By
denouncing it as mere dream nothing is achieved.
<!--l. 2772--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The only thing that can help is to wake up from the dream.
<!--l. 2774--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>An awakener is needed.
<!--l. 2776--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who again is in the dream. The awakener signifies the beginning of
the end. There are no eternal dreams.
<!--l. 2778--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even when it is beginningless?
<!--l. 2780--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everything begins with you. What else is beginningless?
<!--l. 2782--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I began at birth.
<!--l. 2784--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That is what you are told. Is it so? Did you see yourself
beginning?
<!--l. 2786--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I began just now. All else is memory.
<!--l. 2788--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite right. The beginningless begins forever. In the same way, I
give eternally, because I have nothing. To be nothing, to have
nothing, to keep nothing for oneself is the greatest gift, the highest
generosity.

<!--l. 2790--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no self-concern left?
<!--l. 2792--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course I am self-concerned, but the self is all. In practice it takes
the shape of goodwill, unfailing and universal. You may call it love,
all-pervading, all-redeeming. Such love is supremely active &#8211; without
the sense of doing.

<!--l. 2804--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why so much stress on love between man and woman?
<!--l. 2860--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 2868--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Harmony between the inner and the outer is happiness. On the

<!--l. 2870--><p class="noindent" >Q. How does self-identification happen?
<!--l. 2872--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The self by its nature knows itself only. For lack of experience

whatever it perceives it takes to be itself. Battered, it learns to look out
( viveka) and to live alone ( vairagya). When right behaviour (
uparati), becomes normal, a powerful inner urge ( mukmukshutva)
makes it seek its source. The candle of the body is lighted and all
becomes clear and bright.
<!--l. 2874--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the real cause of suffering?
<!--l. 2876--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Self-identification with the limited ( vyaktitva). Sensations
as such, however strong, do not cause suffering. It is the mind
bewildered by wrong ideas, addicted to thinking: &#8216;I am this&#8217;
&#8216;I am that&#8217;, that fears loss and craves gain and suffers when
frustrated.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why is life so full of contradictions?
<!--l. 2892--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It serves to break down mental pride. We must realise how poor
and powerless we are. As long as we delude ourselves by what we
imagine ourselves to be, to know, to have, to do, we are in a sad plight

indeed. Only in complete self-negation there is a chance to discover our
real being.
<!--l. 2894--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why so much stress on self-negation?
<!--l. 2896--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As much as on self-realisation. The false self must be abandoned
before the real self can be found.
<!--l. 2898--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The self you choose to call false is to me most distressingly real. It
is the only self I know. What you call the real self is a mere concept, a
way of speaking, a creature of the mind, an attractive ghost. My daily
self is not a beauty, I admit, but it is my own and only self. You
say I am, or have, another self. Do you see it &#8211; is it a reality
to you, or do you want me to believe what you yourself don&#8217;t
see?
<!--l. 2900--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t jump to conclusions rashly. The concrete need not be the
real, the conceived need not be false. Perceptions based on sensations
and shaped by memory imply a perceiver, whose nature you never
cared to examine. Give it your full attention, examine it with loving
care and you will discover heights and depths of being which you
did not dream of, engrossed as you are in your puny image of
yourself.
<!--l. 2902--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I must be in the right mood to examine myself fruitfully.

<!--l. 2908--><p class="noindent" >M. You are not. You are all the time destroying yourself, and your own,
by serving strange gods, inimical and false. By all means be selfish &#8211;
the right way. Wish yourself well, labour at what is good for you.

Destroy all that stands between you and happiness. Be all &#8211; love all &#8211;

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why is there so much suffering in love?
<!--l. 2914--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All suffering is born of desire. True love is never frustrated. How
can the sense of unity be frustrated? What can be frustrated is the
desire for expression. Such desire is of the mind. As with all things
mental, frustration is inevitable.
<!--l. 2916--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the place of sex in love?
<!--l. 2918--><p class="noindent" ><span

all previous steps as failures. Each brought you nearer to your goal,
even when you had to turn back to by-pass an obstacle. In reality
each step brings you to your goal, because to be always on the
move, learning, discovering, unfolding, is your eternal destiny.
Living is life&#8217;s only purpose. The self does not identify itself with
success or failure &#8211; the very idea of becoming this or that is
unthinkable.
<!--l. 2940--><p class="noindent" >The self understands that success and failure are relative and related,
that they are the very warp and weft of life. Learn from both and go
beyond. If you have not learnt, repeat.
<!--l. 2942--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What am I to learn?
<!--l. 2944--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To live without self-concern. For this you must know your own true

being ( swarupa) as indomitable, fearless, ever victorious. Once you
know with absolute certainty that nothing can trouble you but your
own imagination, you come to disregard your desires and fears,
concepts and ideas and live by truth alone.
<!--l. 2946--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What may be the reason that some people succeed and others fail in
Yoga? Is it destiny or character, or just accident?
<!--l. 2948--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nobody ever fails in Yoga. It is all a matter of the rate of progress.
It is slow in the beginning and rapid in the end. When one is fully
matured, realisation is explosive. It takes place spontaneously, or at
the slightest hint. The quick is not better than the slow. Slow
ripening and rapid flowering alternate. Both are natural and
right.
<!--l. 2950--><p class="noindent" >Yet, all this is so in the mind only. As I see it, there is really nothing
of the kind. In the great mirror of consciousness images arise
and disappear and only memory gives them continuity. And
memory is material &#8211; destructible, perishable, transient. On such
flimsy foundations we build a sense of personal existence &#8211; vague,
intermittent, dreamlike. This vague persuasion: &#8216;I-am-so-and-so&#8217;
<!--l. 2952--><p class="noindent" >obscures the changeless state of pure awareness and makes us believe
that we are born to suffer and to die.
<!--l. 2954--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Just as a child cannot help growing, so does a man, compelled by
nature, make progress. Why exert oneself? Where is the need of
Yoga?
<!--l. 2956--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is progress all the time. Everything contributes to progress.
But this is the progress of ignorance. The circles of ignorance may be
ever widening, yet it remains a bondage all the same. In due course a
Guru appears to teach and inspire us to practise Yoga and a ripening
takes place as a result of which the immemorial night of ignorance

dissolves before the rising sun of wisdom. But in reality nothing
happened. The sun is always there, there is no night to it; the mind
blinded by the &#8216;I am the body&#8217; idea spins out endlessly its thread of
illusion.
<!--l. 2958--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If all is a part of a natural process, where is the need of effort?
<!--l. 2960--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Even effort is a part of it. When ignorance becomes obstinate and
hard and the character gets perverted, effort and the pain of it become
inevitable. In complete obedience to nature there is no effort. The seed
of spiritual life grows in silence and in darkness until its appointed
hour.
<!--l. 2962--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We come across some great people, who, in their old age, become
childish, petty, quarrelsome and spiteful. How could they deteriorate so
much?
<!--l. 2964--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They were not perfect Yogis, having their bodies under complete
control. Or, they might not have cared to protect their bodies from the
natural decay. One must not draw conclusions without understanding
all the factors. Above all, one must not make judgements of inferiority
or superiority.
<!--l. 2966--><p class="noindent" >Youthfulness is more a matter of vitality ( prana) than of wisdom (
jnana) .
<!--l. 2968--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>One may get old, but why should one lose all alertness and
discrimination?
<!--l. 2970--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness and unconsciousness, while in the body depend on
the condition of the brain.
<!--l. 2972--><p class="noindent" >But the self is beyond both, beyond the brain, beyond the mind. The
fault of the instrument is no reflection on its user.

<!--l. 2974--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I was told that a realised man will never do anything unseemly. He
will always behave in an exemplary way.
<!--l. 2976--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who sets the example? Why should a liberated man necessarily
follow conventions? The moment he becomes predictable, he cannot be
free. His freedom lies in his being free to fulfil the need of the moment,
to obey the necessity of the situation. Freedom to do what one likes is
really bondage, while being free to do what one must, what is right, is
real freedom.
<!--l. 2978--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still there must be some way of making out who has realised and
who has not. If one is indistinguishable from the other, of what use is
he?
<!--l. 2980--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He who knows himself has no doubts about it. Nor does he care
whether others recognise his state or not. Rare is the realised man who
discloses his realisation and fortunate are those who have met him, for
he does it for their abiding welfare.
<!--l. 2982--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When one looks round, one is appalled by the volume of
unnecessary suffering that is going on. People who should be helped are
not getting help. Imagine a big hospital ward full of incurables, tossing
and moaning. Were you given the authority to kill them all and end
their torture, would you not do so?
<!--l. 2984--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I would leave it to them to decide.
<!--l. 2986--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But if their destiny is to suffer? How can you interfere with
destiny?
<!--l. 2988--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Their destiny is what happens. There is no thwarting of destiny.
You mean to say everybody&#8217;s life is totally determined at his birth?
What a strange idea! Were it so, the power that determines would see
to it that nobody should suffer.

<!--l. 2990--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What about cause and effect?
<!--l. 2992--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Each moment contains the whole of the past and creates the whole
of the future.
<!--l. 2994--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But past and future exist?
<!--l. 2996--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In the mind only. Time is in the mind, space is in the mind. The
law of cause and effect is also a way of thinking. In reality all is here
and now and all is one. Multiplicity and diversity are in the mind
only.
<!--l. 2998--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still, you are in favour of relieving suffering, even through
destruction of the incurably diseased body.
<!--l. 3000--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again, you look from outside while I look from within. I do not see
a sufferer, I am the sufferer. I know him from within and do what is
right spontaneously and effortlessly. I follow no rules nor lay down
rules. I flow with life &#8211; faithfully and irresistibly.
<!--l. 3002--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still you seem to be a very practical man in full control of your
immediate surroundings.
<!--l. 3004--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else do you expect me to be? A misfit?
<!--l. 3006--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet you cannot help another much.
<!--l. 3008--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Surely, I can help. You too can help. Everybody can help. But the
suffering is all the time recreated. Man alone can destroy in himself the
roots of pain. Others can only help with the pain, but not with its
cause, which is the abysmal stupidity of mankind.
<!--l. 3010--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Will this stupidity ever come to an end?

<!--l. 3012--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In man &#8211; of course. Any moment. In humanity &#8211; as we know it &#8211;
after very many years. In creation &#8211; never, for creation itself is
rooted in ignorance; matter itself is ignorance. Not to know, and
not to know that one does not know, is the cause of endless
suffering.
<!--l. 3014--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are told of the great avatars, the saviours of the world.
<!--l. 3016--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Did they save? They have come and gone &#8211; and the world plods on.
Of course, they did a lot and opened new dimensions in the human
mind. But to talk of saving the world is an exaggeration.
<!--l. 3018--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no salvation for the world?
<!--l. 3020--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Which world do you want to save? The world of your own
projection? Save it yourself. My world? Show me my world and I shall
deal with it. I am not aware of any world separate from myself, which I
am free to save or not to save. What business have you with saving
the world, when all the world needs is to be saved from you?
Get out of the picture and see whether there is anything left to
save.
<!--l. 3022--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You seem to stress the point that without you your world would not
have existed and therefore the only thing you can do for it is to wind
up the show. This is not a way out. Even if the world were of my own
creation, this knowledge does not save it. It only explains it. The
question remains: why did I create such a wretched world and what
can I do to change it? You seem to say: forget it all and admire
your own glory. Surely, you don&#8217;t mean it. The description of a
disease and its causes does not cure it. What we need is the right
medicine.
<!--l. 3024--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The description and causation are the remedy for a disease
caused by obtuseness and stupidity. Just like a deficiency disease

is cured through the supply of the missing factor, so are the
diseases of living cured by a good dose of intelligent detachment. (
viveka-vairagya).
<!--l. 3026--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You cannot save the world by preaching counsels of perfection.
People are as they are. Must they suffer?
<!--l. 3028--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as they are as they are, there is no escape from
suffering. Remove the sense of separateness and there will be no
conflict.
<!--l. 3030--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A message in print may be paper and ink only. It is the text that
matters. By analysing the world into elements and qualities we miss the
most important &#8211; its meaning. Your reduction of everything to
dream disregards the difference between the dream of an insect
and the dream of a poet. All is dream, granted. But not all are
equal.
<!--l. 3032--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The dreams are not equal, but the dreamer is one. I am the insect.
I am the poet &#8211; in dream.
<!--l. 3034--><p class="noindent" >But in reality I am neither. I am beyond all dreams. I am the light in
which all dreams appear and disappear. I am both inside and outside
the dream. Just as a man having headache knows the ache and also
knows that he is not the ache, so do I know the dream, myself
dreaming and myself not dreaming &#8211; all at the same time. I am what I
am before, during and after the dream. But what I see in dream, l am
not.
<!--l. 3036--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is all a matter of imagination. One imagines that one is
dreaming, another imagines one is not dreaming. Are not both the
same?
<!--l. 3038--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The same and not the same. Not dreaming, as an interval between

two dreams, is of course, a Part of dreaming. Not dreaming as a steady
hold on, and timeless abidance in reality has nothing to do with
dreaming. In that sense I never dream, nor ever shall.
<!--l. 3040--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If both dream and escape from dream are imaginings, what is the
way out?
<!--l. 3042--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no need of a way out! Don&#8217;t you see that a way out is also
a part of the dream? All you have to do is to see the dream as
dream.
<!--l. 3044--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I start the practice of dismissing everything as a dream where will
it lead me?
<!--l. 3046--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Wherever it leads you, it will be a dream. The very idea of going
beyond the dream is illusory.
<!--l. 3048--><p class="noindent" >Why go anywhere? Just realise that you are dreaming a dream you call
the world, and stop looking for ways out. The dream is not your
problem. Your problem is that you like one part of your dream and not
another. Love all, or none of it, and stop complaining. When you have
seen the dream as a dream, you have done all that needs be
done.
<!--l. 3050--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is dreaming caused by thinking?
<!--l. 3052--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everything is a play of ideas. In the state free from ideation (
nirvikalpa samadhi) nothing is perceived. The root idea is: &#8216;I am&#8217;.
It shatters the state of pure consciousness and is followed by
the innumerable sensations and perceptions, feeling and ideas
which in their totality constitute God and His world. The &#8216;I am&#8217;
remains as the witness, but it is by the will of God that everything
happens.

<!--l. 3054--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why not by my will?
<!--l. 3056--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again you have split yourself &#8211; into God and witness. Both are
one.

<!--l. 3059--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>There are so many theories about the nature of man and

any number of them. Which is true?
<!--l. 3061--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 3065--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>These are all ways of putting words together. Some favour one way,
some favour another.
<!--l. 3067--><p class="noindent" >Theories are neither right nor wrong. They are attempts at explaining
the inexplicable. It is not the theory that matters, but the way
it is being tested. It is the testing of the theory that makes it
fruitful.
<!--l. 3069--><p class="noindent" >Experiment with any theory you like &#8211; if you are truly earnest and
honest, the attainment of reality will be yours. As a living being you
are caught in an untenable and painful situation and you are seeking a
way out. You are being offered several plans of your prison, none
quite true. But they all are of some value, only if you are in
dead earnest. It is the earnestness that liberates and not the
theory.
<!--l. 3071--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Theory may be misleading and earnestness &#8211; blind.
<!--l. 3073--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your sincerity will guide you. Devotion to the goal of freedom and
perfection will make you abandon all theories and systems and live
by wisdom, intelligence and active love. Theories may be good
as starting points, but must be abandoned, the sooner &#8211; the
better.

<!--l. 3075--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is a Yogi who says that for realisation the eightfold Yoga
is not necessary; that will-power alone will do. It is enough to
concentrate on the goal with full confidence in the power of pure will
to obtain effortlessly and quickly what others take decades to
achieve.
<!--l. 3077--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Concentration, full confidence, pure will! With such assets no
wonder one attains in no time.
<!--l. 3079--><p class="noindent" >This Yoga of will is all right for the mature seeker, who has shed all
desires but one. After all, what is will but steadiness of heart and mind.
Given such steadfastness all can be achieved.
<!--l. 3081--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I feel the Yogi did not mean mere steadiness of purpose, resulting in
ceaseless pursuit and application. He meant that with will fixed on the
goal no pursuit or application are needed. The mere fact of willing
attracts its object.
<!--l. 3083--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whatever name you give it: will, or steady purpose, or
one-pointedness of the mind, you come back to earnestness, sincerity,
honesty. When you are in dead earnest, you bend every incident, every
second of your life to your purpose. You do not waste time and energy
on other things. You are totally dedicated, call it will, or love, or plain
honesty. We are complex beings, at war within and without. We
contradict ourselves all the time, undoing today the work of yesterday.
No wonder we are stuck. A little of integrity would make a lot of
difference.
<!--l. 3085--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is more powerful, desire or destiny?
<!--l. 3087--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Desire shapes destiny.
<!--l. 3089--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And destiny shapes desire. My desires are conditioned by heredity
and circumstances, by opportunities and accidents, by what we call

destiny.
<!--l. 3091--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, you may say so.
<!--l. 3093--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>At what point am I free to desire what I want to desire?
<!--l. 3095--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are free now. What is it that you want to desire? Desire
it.
<!--l. 3097--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Of course I am free to desire, but I am not free to act on my desire.
Other urges will lead me astray. My desire is not strong enough, even if
it has my approval. Other desires, which I disapprove of are
stronger.
<!--l. 3099--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe you are deceiving yourself. Maybe you are giving expression
to your real desires and the ones you approve of are kept on the surface
for the sake of respectability.
<!--l. 3101--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It may be as you say, but this is another theory. The fact is that I
do not feel free to desire what I think I should, and when I seem to
desire rightly, I do not act accordingly.
<!--l. 3103--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is all due to weakness of the mind and disintegration of the
brain. Collect and strengthen your mind and you will find that your
thoughts and feelings, words and actions will align themselves in the
direction of your will.
<!--l. 3105--><p class="noindent" ><span

is not an easy task! How does one begin?
<!--l. 3107--><p class="noindent" ><span

cannot get out of here and now.
<!--l. 3109--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 3111--><p class="noindent" ><span

help me much.
<!--l. 3119--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You were aware of thinking, feeling, doing. You were not aware of
your being.
<!--l. 3121--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the new factor you want me to bring in?
<!--l. 3123--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The attitude of pure witnessing, of watching the events without
taking part in them.
<!--l. 3125--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What will it do to me?
<!--l. 3127--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Weak-mindedness is due to lack of intelligence, of understanding,
which again is the result of non-awareness. By striving for awareness
you bring your mind together and strengthen it.
<!--l. 3129--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I may be fully aware of what is going on, and yet quite unable to
influence it in any way.
<!--l. 3131--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are mistaken. What is going on is a projection of your
mind. A weak mind cannot control its own projections. Be aware,
therefore, of your mind and its projections. You cannot control
what you do not know. On the other hand, knowledge gives
power. In practice it is very simple. To control yourself &#8211; know
yourself.
<!--l. 3133--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Maybe, I can come to control myself, but shall I be able to deal

with the chaos in the world?
<!--l. 3135--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no chaos in the world, except the chaos which your mind
creates. It is self-created in the sense that at its very centre is the false
idea of oneself as a thing different and separate from other things. In
reality you are not a thing, nor separate. You are the infinite
potentiality; the inexhaustible possibility. Because you are, all can be.
The universe is but a partial manifestation of your limitless capacity to
become.
<!--l. 3137--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find that I am totally motivated by desire for pleasure and fear of

are the two poles between which my life oscillates.
<!--l. 3139--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Go to the source of both pain and pleasure, of desire and fear.
Observe, investigate, try to understand.
<!--l. 3141--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Desire and fear both are feelings caused by physical or mental
factors. They are there, easily observable. But why are they there?
Why do l desire pleasure and fear pain?
<!--l. 3143--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pleasure and pain are states of mind. As long as you think you are
the mind, or rather, the body-mind, you are bound to raise such
questions.
<!--l. 3145--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And when I realise that I am not the body, shall I be free from
desire and fear?
<!--l. 3147--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as there is a body and a mind to protect the body,
attractions and repulsions will operate. They will be there, out in the
field of events, but will not concern you. The focus of your attention
will be elsewhere. You will not be distracted.
<!--l. 3149--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still they will be there. Will one never be completely free?

<!--l. 3151--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are completely free even now. What you call destiny ( karma)
is but the result of your own will to live. How strong is this will you can
judge by the universal horror of death.
<!--l. 3153--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>People die willingly quite often.
<!--l. 3155--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Only when the alternative is worse than death. But such readiness
to die flows from the same source as the will to live, a source deeper
even than life itself. To be a living being is not the ultimate state; there
is something beyond, much more wonderful, which is neither being nor
non-being, neither living nor not-living. It is a state of pure awareness,
beyond the limitations of space and time. Once the illusion that the
body-mind is oneself is abandoned, death loses its terror, it becomes a
part of living.

<!--l. 3158--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>As I look at you, you seem to be a poor man with very
limited means, facing all the problems of poverty and old age, like
everybody else.
<!--l. 3160--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Were I very rich, what difference would it make? I am
what I am. What else can I be? I am neither rich nor poor, I am
myself.
<!--l. 3162--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet, you are experiencing pleasure and pain.
<!--l. 3164--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am experiencing these in consciousness, but I am neither
consciousness, nor its content.
<!--l. 3166--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You say that in our real being we are all equal. How is it that your
experience is so different from ours.
<!--l. 3168--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>My actual experience is not different. It is my evaluation and
attitude that differ. I see the same world as you do, but not the same
way. There is nothing mysterious about it. Everybody sees the world
through the idea he has of himself. As you think yourself to be, so
you think the world to be. If you imagine yourself as separate
from the world, the world will appear as separate from you and
you will experience desire and fear. I do not see the world as
separate from me and so there is nothing for me to desire, or
fear.
<!--l. 3170--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You are a point of light in the world. Not everybody is.
<!--l. 3172--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is absolutely no difference between me and others, except in
my knowing myself as I am.
<!--l. 3174--><p class="noindent" >I am all. I know it for certain and you do not.

<!--l. 3176--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So we differ all the same.
<!--l. 3178--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No, we do not. The difference is only in the mind and temporary. I
was like you, you will be like me.
<!--l. 3180--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>God made a most diversified world.
<!--l. 3182--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The diversity is in you only. See yourself as you are and you will see
the world as it is &#8211; a single block of reality, indivisible, indescribable.
Your own creative power projects upon it a picture and all your
questions refer to the picture.
<!--l. 3184--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A Tibetan Yogi wrote that God creates the world for a purpose and
runs it according to a plan.
<!--l. 3186--><p class="noindent" >The purpose is good and the plan is most wise.
<!--l. 3188--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All this is temporary, while I am dealing with the eternal. Gods
and their universes come and go, avatars follow each other in endless
succession, and in the end we are back at the source. I talk only of the
timeless source of all the gods with all their universes, past, present and
future.
<!--l. 3190--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you know them all? Do you remember them?
<!--l. 3192--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When a few boys stage a play for fun, what is there to see and to
remember?
<!--l. 3194--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why is half humanity male and half female?
<!--l. 3196--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>For their happiness. The impersonal ( avyakta) becomes the
personal ( vyakta) for the sake of happiness in relationship. By the
grace of my Guru I can look with equal eye on the impersonal as well
as the personal. Both are one to me. In life the personal merges in the

impersonal.
<!--l. 3198--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does the personal emerge from the impersonal?
<!--l. 3200--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The two are but aspects of one Reality. It is not correct to talk of
one preceding the other. All these ideas belong to the waking
state.
<!--l. 3202--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What brings in the waking state?
<!--l. 3204--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>At the root of all creation lies desire. Desire and imagination foster
and reinforce each other.
<!--l. 3206--><p class="noindent" >The fourth state ( turiya) is a state of pure witnessing, detached
awareness, passionless and wordless. It is like space, unaffected by
whatever it contains. Bodily and mental troubles do not reach it &#8211; they
are outside, &#8216;there&#8217;, while the witness is always &#8216;here&#8217;.
<!--l. 3208--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is real, the subjective or the objective? I am inclined to
believe that the objective universe is the real one and my subjective
psyche is changeful and transient. You seem to claim reality for your
inner, subjective states and deny all reality to the concrete, external
world.
<!--l. 3210--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Both the subjective and the objective are changeful and transient.
There is nothing real about them. Find the permanent in the fleeting,
the one constant factor in every experience.
<!--l. 3212--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is this constant factor?
<!--l. 3214--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>My giving it various names and pointing it out in many ways
will not help you much, unless you have the capacity to see. A
dim-sighted man will not see the parrot on the branch of a tree,
however much you may prompt him to look. At best he will

see your pointed finger. First purify your vision, learn to see
instead of staring, and you will perceive the parrot. Also you
must be eager to see. You need both clarity and earnestness for
self-knowledge. You need maturity of heart and mind, which
comes through earnest application in daily life of whatever little
you have understood. There is no such thing as compromise in
Yoga.
<!--l. 3216--><p class="noindent" >If you want to sin, sin wholeheartedly and openly. Sins too have their
lessons to teach the earnest sinner, as virtues &#8211; the earnest saint. It is
the mixing up the two that is so disastrous. Nothing can block you so
effectively as compromise, for it shows lack of earnestness, without
which nothing can be done.
<!--l. 3218--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I approve of austerity, but in practice I am all for luxury. The habit
of chasing pleasure and shunning pain is so ingrained in me, that all
my good intentions, quite alive on the level of theory, find no
roots in my day-to-day life. To tell me that I am not honest
does not help me, for I just do not know how to make myself
honest.
<!--l. 3220--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are neither honest nor dishonest &#8211; giving names to mental
states is good only for expressing your approval or disapproval. The
problem is not yours &#8211; it is your mind&#8217;s only. Begin by disassociating
yourself from your mind. Resolutely remind yourself that you are not
the mind and that its problems are not yours.
<!--l. 3222--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I may go on telling myself: &#8216;I am not the mind, I am not concerned
with its problems,&#8217; but the mind remains and its problems remain just
as they were. Now, please do not tell me that it is because I am not
earnest enough and I should be more earnest! I know it and admit it
and only ask you &#8211; how is it done?
<!--l. 3224--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>At least you are asking! Good enough, for a start. Go on

pondering, wondering, being anxious to find a way. Be conscious of
yourself, watch your mind, give it your full attention. Don&#8217;t look for
quick results; there may be none within your noticing. Unknown
to you, your psyche will undergo a change, there will be more
clarity in your thinking, charity in your feeling, purity in your
behaviour.
<!--l. 3226--><p class="noindent" >You need not aim at these &#8211; you will witness the change all the same.
For, what you are now is the result of inattention and what you become
will be the fruit of attention.
<!--l. 3228--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should mere attention make all the difference?
<!--l. 3230--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So far your life was dark and restless ( tamas and rajas). Attention,
alertness, awareness, clarity, liveliness, vitality, are all manifestations of
integrity, oneness with your true nature ( sattva). It is in the
nature of sattva to reconcile and neutralise tamas and rajas and
rebuild the personality in accordance with the true nature of the
self. Sattva is the faithful servant of the self; ever attentive and
obedient.
<!--l. 3232--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And I shall come to it through mere attention?
<!--l. 3234--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Do not undervalue attention. It means interest and also love.
To know, to do, to discover, or to create you must give your
heart to it &#8211; which means attention. All the blessings flow from
it.
<!--l. 3236--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You advise us to concentrate on &#8216;I am&#8217;. Is this too a form of
attention?
<!--l. 3238--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else? Give your undivided attention to the most important in
your life &#8211; yourself. Of your personal universe you are the centre &#8211;
without knowing the centre what else can you know?

<!--l. 3240--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But how can I know myself? To know myself I must be away
from myself. But what is away from myself cannot be myself.
So, it looks that I cannot know myself, only what I take to be
myself.
<!--l. 3242--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite right. As you cannot see your face, but only its reflection in
the mirror, so you can know only your image reflected in the stainless
mirror of pure awareness.
<!--l. 3244--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to get such stainless mirror?
<!--l. 3246--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Obviously, by removing stains. See the stains and remove them.
The ancient teaching is fully valid.
<!--l. 3248--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is seeing and what is removing?
<!--l. 3250--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The nature of the perfect mirror is such that you cannot see it.
Whatever you can see is bound to be a stain. Turn away from it, give it
up, know it as unwanted.
<!--l. 3252--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All perceivables, are they stains?
<!--l. 3254--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All are stains.
<!--l. 3256--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The entire world is a stain.
<!--l. 3258--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, it is.
<!--l. 3260--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How awful! So, the universe is of no value?
<!--l. 3262--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is of tremendous value. By going beyond it you realise
yourself.
<!--l. 3264--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But why did it come into being in the first instance?

<!--l. 3266--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You will know it when it ends.
<!--l. 3268--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Will it ever end?
<!--l. 3270--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, for you.
<!--l. 3272--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When did it begin?
<!--l. 3274--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Now.
<!--l. 3276--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When will it end?
<!--l. 3278--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Now.
<!--l. 3280--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It does not end now?
<!--l. 3282--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You don&#8217;t let it.
<!--l. 3284--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I want to let it.
<!--l. 3286--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You don&#8217;t. All your life is connected with it. Your past and future,
your desires and fears, all have their roots in the world. Without the
world where are you, who are you?
<!--l. 3288--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But that is exactly what I came to find out.
<!--l. 3290--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>. And I am telling you exactly this: find a foothold beyond and all
will be clear and easy.

<!--l. 3294--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>We two came from far off countries; one of us is British,
the other American. The world in which we were born is falling apart
and, being young, we are concerned. The old people hope they will die
their own death, but the young have no such hope. Some of us may
refuse to kill, but none can refuse to be killed. Can we hope to set the
world right within our lifetime?
<!--l. 3296--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>What makes you think that the world is going to
perish?
<!--l. 3298--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The instruments of destruction have become unbelievably potent.
Also, our very productivity has become destructive of nature and of our
cultural and social values.
<!--l. 3300--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are talking of the present times. It has been so everywhere and
always. But the distressing situation may be temporary and local. Once
over, it will be forgotten.
<!--l. 3302--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The scale of the impending catastrophe is unbelievably big. We live
in the midst of an explosion.
<!--l. 3304--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Each man suffers alone and dies alone. Numbers are irrelevant.
There is as much death when a million die as when one perishes.
<!--l. 3306--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Nature kills by the millions, but this does not frighten me. There
may be tragedy or mystery in it, but no cruelty. What horrifies me is
man-made suffering, destruction and desolation. Nature is magnificent
in its doings and undoings. But there is meanness and madness in the
acts of man.
<!--l. 3308--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Right. So, it is not suffering and death that are your problem,
but the meanness and madness at their root. Is not meanness

also a form of madness? And is not madness the misuse of the
mind?
<!--l. 3310--><p class="noindent" >Humanity&#8217;s problem lies in this misuse of the mind only. All the
treasures of nature and spirit are open to man who will use his mind
rightly.
<!--l. 3312--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the right use of mind?
<!--l. 3314--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Fear and greed cause the misuse of the mind. The right use of mind
is in the service of love, of life, of truth, of beauty.
<!--l. 3316--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Easier said than done. Love of truth, of man, goodwill &#8211; what
luxury! We need plenty of it to set the world right, but who will
provide?
<!--l. 3318--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can spend an eternity looking elsewhere for truth and
love, intelligence and goodwill, imploring God and man &#8211; all
in vain. You must begin in yourself, with yourself &#8211; this is the
inexorable law. You cannot change the image without changing the
face. First realise that your world is only a reflection of yourself
and stop finding fault with the reflection. Attend to yourself,
set yourself right &#8211; mentally and emotionally. The physical will
follow automatically. You talk so much of reforms: economic,
social, political. Leave alone the reforms and mind the reformer.
What kind of world can a man create who is stupid, greedy,
heartless?
<!--l. 3320--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If we have to wait for a change of heart, we shall have to wait
indefinitely. Yours is a counsel of perfection, which is also a counsel of
despair. When all are perfect, the world will be perfect. What useless
truism!
<!--l. 3322--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I did not say it. I only said: You cannot change the world before

changing yourself. I did not say
<!--l. 3324--><p class="noindent" >&#8211; before changing everybody. It is neither necessary, nor possible to
change others. But if you can change yourself you will find that no
other change is needed. To change the picture you merely change the
film, you do not attack the cinema screen!
<!--l. 3326--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can you be so sure of yourself? How do you know that what
you say is true?
<!--l. 3328--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not of myself that I am sure, I am sure of you. All you
need is to stop searching outside what can be found only within.
Set your vision right before you operate. You are suffering from
acute misapprehension. Clarify your mind, purify your heart,
sanctify your life &#8211; this is the quickest way to a change of your
world.
<!--l. 3330--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So many saints and mystics lived and died. They did not change my
world.
<!--l. 3332--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How could they? Your world is not theirs, nor is their yours.
<!--l. 3334--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely there is a factual world common to all.
<!--l. 3336--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world of things, of energy and matter? Even if there were such
a common world of things and forces, it is not the world in which we
live. Ours is a world of feelings and ideas, of attractions and repulsions,
of scales of values, of motives and incentives, a mental world
altogether.
<!--l. 3338--><p class="noindent" >Biologically we need very little, our problems are of a different order.
Problems created by desires and fears and wrong ideas can be solved
only on the level of the mind. You must conquer your own mind and for
this you must go beyond it.

<!--l. 3340--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What does it mean to go beyond the mind.
<!--l. 3342--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have gone beyond the body, haven&#8217;t you? You do not closely
follow your digestion, circulation or elimination. These have become
automatic. In the same way the mind should work automatically,
without calling for attention. This will not happen unless the mind
works faultlessly.
<!--l. 3344--><p class="noindent" >We are, most of our time mind and body-conscious, because they
constantly call for help. Pain and suffering are only the body and the
mind screaming for attention. To go beyond the body you must be
healthy: To go beyond the mind, you must have your mind in perfect
order. You cannot leave a mess behind and go beyond. The mess will
bog you up. &#8216;Pick up your rubbish&#8217; seems to be the universal law. And
a just law too.
<!--l. 3346--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Am I permitted to ask you how did you go beyond the mind?
<!--l. 3348--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By the grace of my Guru.
<!--l. 3350--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What shape his grace took?
<!--l. 3352--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He told me what is true.
<!--l. 3354--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What did he tell you?
<!--l. 3356--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He told me I am the Supreme Reality.
<!--l. 3358--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What did you do about it?
<!--l. 3360--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I trusted him and remembered it.
<!--l. 3362--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is that all?

<!--l. 3364--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, I remembered him; I remembered what he said.
<!--l. 3366--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You mean to say that this was enough?
<!--l. 3368--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What more needs be done? It was quite a lot to remember the
Guru and his words. My advice to you is even less difficult than this &#8211;
just remember yourself. &#8216;I am&#8217;, is enough to heal your mind and take
you beyond. Just have some trust. I don&#8217;t mislead you. Why should l?
Do I want anything from you. I wish you well &#8211; such is my nature. Why
should I mislead you?
<!--l. 3370--><p class="noindent" >Commonsense too will tell you that to fulfil a desire you must keep
your mind on it. If you want to know your true nature, you must have
yourself in mind all the time, until the secret of your being stands
revealed.
<!--l. 3372--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should self-remembrance bring one to self-realisation?
<!--l. 3374--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because they are but two aspects of the same state. Self-remembrance
is in the mind, self-realisation is beyond the mind. The image in the
mirror is of the face beyond the mirror.
<!--l. 3376--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Fair enough. But what is the purpose?
<!--l. 3378--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To help others, one must be beyond the need of help.
<!--l. 3380--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All I want is to be happy.
<!--l. 3382--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Be happy to make happy.
<!--l. 3384--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Let others take care of themselves.
<!--l. 3386--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Sir, you are not separate. The happiness you cannot share is
spurious. Only the shareable is truly desirable.

<!--l. 3388--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Right. But do I need a Guru? What you tell me is simple and
convincing. I shall remember it.
<!--l. 3390--><p class="noindent" >This does not make you my Guru.
<!--l. 3392--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>it is not the worship of a person that is crucial, but the steadiness
and depth of your devotion to the task. Life itself is the Supreme Guru;
be attentive to its lessons and obedient to its commands.
<!--l. 3394--><p class="noindent" >When you personalise their source, you have an outer Guru; when you
take them from life directly, the Guru is within. Remember, wonder,
ponder, live with it, love it, grow into it, grow with it, make it your
own &#8211; the word of your Guru, outer or inner. Put in all and you will get
all. I was doing it. All my time I was giving to my Guru and to what he
told me.
<!--l. 3396--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am a writer by profession. Can you give me some advice, for me
specifically?
<!--l. 3398--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Writing is both a talent and a skill. Grow in talent and develop in
skill. Desire what is worth desiring and desire it well. Just like you pick
your way in a crowd, passing between people, so you find your way
between events, without missing your general direction. It is easy, if
you are earnest.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So many times you mention the need of being earnest. But
we are not men of single will. We are congeries of desires and
needs, instincts and promptings. They crawl over each other,
sometimes one, sometimes another dominating, but never for
long.
<!--l. 3402--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There are no needs, desires only.
<!--l. 3404--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To eat, to drink, to shelter one&#8217;s body; to live?

<!--l. 3406--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The desire to live is the one fundamental desire. All else depends on
it.
<!--l. 3408--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We live, because we must.
<!--l. 3410--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>We live, because we crave sensory existence.
<!--l. 3412--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A thing so universal cannot be wrong.
<!--l. 3414--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not wrong, of course. In its own place and time nothing is wrong.
But when you are concerned with truth, with reality, you must
question every thing, your very life. By asserting the necessity of
sensory and intellectual experience you narrow down your enquiry to
search for comfort.
<!--l. 3416--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I seek happiness, not comfort.
<!--l. 3418--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Beyond comfort of mind and body what happiness do you
know?
<!--l. 3420--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there any other?
<!--l. 3422--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Find out for yourself. Question every urge, hold no desire
legitimate. Empty of possession, physical and mental, free of all
self-concern, be open for discovery.
<!--l. 3424--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is a part of Indian spiritual tradition that mere living in the
proximity of a saint or sage is conducive to liberation and no other
means are needed. Why don&#8217;t you organise an Ashram so that people
could live near you?
<!--l. 3426--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The moment I create an institution I become its prisoner. As a
matter of fact I am available to all.

<!--l. 3428--><p class="noindent" >Common roof and food will not make people more welcome. &#8216;Living
near&#8217; does not mean breathing the same air. It means trusting and
obeying, not letting the good intentions of the teacher go to
waste. Have your Guru always in your heart and remember his
instructions &#8211; this is real abidance with the true. Physical proximity
is least important. Make your entire life an expression of your
faith and love for your teacher &#8211; this is real dwelling with the
Guru.

<!--l. 3431--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Does a jnani die?
<!--l. 3433--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>He is beyond life and death. What we take to be inevitable
&#8211; to be born and to die &#8211;
<!--l. 3435--><p class="noindent" >appears to him but a way of expressing movement in the Immovable,
change in the changeless, end in the endless. To the jnani it is obvious
that nothing is born and nothing dies, nothing lasts and nothing
changes, all is as it is &#8211; timelessly.
<!--l. 3437--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You say the jnani is beyond. Beyond what? Beyond knowledge?
<!--l. 3439--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Knowledge has its rising and setting. Consciousness comes into
being and goes out of being. It is a matter of daily occurrence and
observation. We all know that sometimes we are conscious and
sometimes not. When we are not conscious, it appears to us as a
darkness or a blank. But a jnani is aware of himself as neither conscious
nor unconscious, but purely aware, a witness to the three states of the
mind and their contents.
<!--l. 3441--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When does this witnessing begin?
<!--l. 3443--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To a jnani nothing has beginning or ending. As salt dissolves in
water, so does everything dissolve into pure being. Wisdom is eternally
negating the unreal. To see the unreal is wisdom.
<!--l. 3445--><p class="noindent" >Beyond this lies the inexpressible.
<!--l. 3447--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is in me the conviction: &#8216;I am the body&#8217; Granted, I am
talking from unwisdom. But the state of feeling oneself the body, the
body-mind, the mind-body, or even pure mind &#8211; when did it
begin?

<!--l. 3449--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You cannot speak of a beginning of consciousness. The very ideas of
beginning and time are within consciousness. To talk meaningfully of
the beginning of anything, you must step out of it. And the moment
you step out, you realise that there is no such thing and never was.
There is only reality, in which no &#8216;thing&#8217; has any being on its own. Like
waves are inseparable from the ocean, so is all existence rooted in
being.
<!--l. 3451--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The fact is that here and now I am asking you: when did the feeling
&#8216;I am the body&#8217; arise? At my birth? or this morning?
<!--l. 3453--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Now.
<!--l. 3455--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 3457--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 3461--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That is how you imagine &#8211; now.
<!--l. 3463--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There must have been a beginning.
<!--l. 3465--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Now.
<!--l. 3467--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what about ending?
<!--l. 3469--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What has no beginning cannot end.
<!--l. 3471--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But I am conscious of my question.
<!--l. 3473--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A false question cannot be answered. It can only be seen as
false.

<!--l. 3475--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To me it is real.
<!--l. 3477--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When did it appear real to you? Now.
<!--l. 3479--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, it is quite real to me &#8211; now.
<!--l. 3481--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is real about your question? It is a state of mind. No state of
mind can be more real than the mind itself. Is the mind real? It is but
a collection of states, each of them transitory. How can a succession of
transitory states be considered real?
<!--l. 3483--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Like beads on a string, events follow events &#8211; for ever.
<!--l. 3485--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They are all strung on the basic idea: &#8216;I am the body&#8217;. But even
this is a mental state and does not last. It comes and goes like all other
states. The illusion of being the body-mind is there, only because it
is not investigated. Non-investigation is the thread on which
all the states of mind are strung. It is like darkness in a closed
room. It is there &#8211; apparently. But when the room is opened,
where does it go? It goes nowhere, because it was not there. All
states of mind, all names and forms of existence are rooted in
non-enquiry, non-investigation, in imagination and credulity. It
is right to say &#8216;I am&#8217;, but to say &#8216;I am this&#8217;, &#8216;I am that&#8217; is a
sign of not enquiring, not examining, of mental weakness or
lethargy.
<!--l. 3487--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If all is light, how did darkness arise? How can there be darkness in
the midst of light?
<!--l. 3489--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no darkness in the midst of light. Self-forgetfulness is the
darkness. When we are absorbed in other things, in the not-self, we
forget the self. There is nothing unnatural about it. But, why forget the
self through excess of attachment? Wisdom lies in never forgetting the
self as the ever-present source of both the experiencer and his

experience.
<!--l. 3491--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In my present state the &#8216;I am the body&#8217; idea comes spontaneously,
while the &#8216;I am pure being&#8217;
<!--l. 3493--><p class="noindent" >idea must be imposed on the mind as something true but not
experienced.
<!--l. 3495--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, sadhana (practice) consists in reminding oneself forcibly of
one&#8217;s pure &#8216;being-ness&#8217;, of not being anything in particular, nor a
sum of particulars, not even the totality of all particulars, which
make up a universe. All exists in the mind, even the body is an
integration in the mind of a vast number of sensory perceptions, each
perception also a mental state. If you say: &#8216;I am the body&#8217;, show
it.
<!--l. 3497--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Here it is.
<!--l. 3499--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Only when you think of it. Both mind and body are intermittent
states. The sum total of these flashes creates the illusion of existence.
Enquire what is permanent in the transient, real in the unreal. This is
sadhana.
<!--l. 3501--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The fact is that I am thinking of myself as the body.
<!--l. 3503--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Think of yourself by all means. Only don&#8217;t bring the idea of a body
into the picture. There is only a stream of sensations, perceptions,
memories and ideations. The body is an abstraction, created
by our tendency to seek unity in diversity &#8211; which again is not
wrong.
<!--l. 3505--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am being told that to think &#8216;I am the body&#8217; is a blemish in the
mind.

<!--l. 3507--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why talk like this? Such expressions create problems. The self is
the source of all, and of all &#8211;
<!--l. 3509--><p class="noindent" >the final destination. Nothing is external.
<!--l. 3511--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When the body idea becomes obsessive, is it not altogether
wrong?
<!--l. 3513--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is nothing wrong in the idea of a body, nor even in the
idea &#8216;I am the body&#8217;. But limiting oneself to one body only is a
mistake. In reality all existence, every form, is my own, within
my consciousness. I cannot tell what I am because words can
describe only what I am not. I am, and because I am, all is. But
I am beyond consciousness and, therefore, in consciousness I
cannot say what I am. Yet, I am. The question &#8216;Who am I&#8217; has
no answer. No experience can answer it, for the self is beyond
experience.
<!--l. 3515--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still, the question &#8216;Who am I&#8217; must be of some use.
<!--l. 3517--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It has no answer in consciousness and, therefore, helps to go
beyond consciousness.
<!--l. 3519--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Here I am &#8211; in the present moment. What is real in it, and what is
not? Now, please don&#8217;t tell me that my question is wrong. Questioning
my questions leads me nowhere.
<!--l. 3521--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your question is not wrong. It is unnecessary. You said: &#8216;Here and
now I am&#8217;. Stop there, this is real. Don&#8217;t turn a fact into a question.
There lies your mistake. You are neither knowing nor not-knowing,
neither mind nor matter; don&#8217;t attempt to describe yourself in terms of
mind and matter.
<!--l. 3523--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Just now a boy came to you with a problem. You told him a few

words and he went away. Did you help him?
<!--l. 3525--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course.
<!--l. 3527--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Wow can you be so sure?
<!--l. 3529--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To help is my nature.
<!--l. 3531--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How did you come to know It?
<!--l. 3533--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No need to know. It operates by itself.
<!--l. 3535--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still you have made a statement. On what is it based?
<!--l. 3537--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On what people tell me. But it is you who asks for proofs. I
do not need them. Setting things right lies in my very nature,
which is satyam, shivam, sundaram (the true, the good, the
beautiful).
<!--l. 3539--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When a man comes to you for advice and you give him advice,
wherefrom does it come and by what power does it help?
<!--l. 3541--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>His own being affects his mind and induces a response.
<!--l. 3543--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what is your role?
<!--l. 3545--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In me the man and his self come together.
<!--l. 3547--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why does not the self help the man without you?
<!--l. 3549--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But I am the self! You imagine me as separate, hence your
question. There is no &#8216;my self&#8217; and &#8216;his self&#8217;. There is the Self, the only
Self of all. Misled by the diversity of names and shapes, minds and
bodies, you imagine multiple selves. We both are the self, but you seem

to be unconvinced.
<!--l. 3552--><p class="noindent" >This talk of personal self and universal self is the learner&#8217;s stage; go
beyond, don&#8217;t be stuck in duality.
<!--l. 3554--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Let us come back to the man in need of help. He comes to
you.
<!--l. 3556--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If he comes, he is sure to get help. Because he was destined to
get help, he came. There is nothing fanciful about it. I cannot
help some and refuse others. All who come are helped, for such
is the law. Only the shape help takes varies according to the
need.
<!--l. 3558--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why must he come here to get advice? Can&#8217;t he get it from
within?
<!--l. 3560--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He will not listen. His mind is turned outward. But in fact all
experience is in the mind, and even his coming to me and getting help
is all within himself. Instead of finding an answer within himself, he
imagines an answer from without. To me there is no me, no man and
no giving. All this is merely a flicker in the mind. I am infinite
peace and silence in which nothing appears, for all that appears
&#8211;
<!--l. 3562--><p class="noindent" >disappears. Nobody comes for help, nobody offers help, nobody gets
help. It is all but a display in consciousness.
<!--l. 3564--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet the power to help is there and there is somebody or something
that displays that power, call it God or Self or the Universal Mind. The
name does not matter, but the fact does.
<!--l. 3566--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This is the stand the body-mind takes. The pure mind sees things
as they are &#8211; bubbles in consciousness. These bubbles are appearing,

disappearing and reappearing &#8211; without having real being. No
particular cause can be ascribed to them, for each is caused by all
and affects all. Each bubble is a body and all these bodies are
mine.
<!--l. 3568--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you mean to say, that you have the power to do everything
rightly?
<!--l. 3570--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no power as separate from me. It is inherent in
my very nature. Call it creativity. Out of a lump of gold you
can make many ornaments &#8211; each will remain gold. Similarly,
in whatever role I may appear and whatever function I may
perform &#8211; I remain what I am: the &#8216;I am&#8217; immovable, unshakable,
independent. What you call the universe, nature, is my spontaneous
creativity.
<!--l. 3572--><p class="noindent" >Whatever happens &#8211; happens. But such is my nature that all ends in
joy.
<!--l. 3574--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have a case of a boy gone blind because his stupid mother fed him
methyl alcohol. I am requesting you to help him. You are full of
compassion and, obviously, eager to help. By what power can you help
him?
<!--l. 3576--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>His case is registered in consciousness. It is there &#8211; indelibly.
Consciousness will operate.
<!--l. 3578--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it make any difference that I ask you to help?
<!--l. 3580--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your asking is a part of the boy&#8217;s blindness. Because he is blind,
you ask. You have added nothing.
<!--l. 3582--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But your help will be a new factor?

<!--l. 3584--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No, all is contained in the boy&#8217;s blindness. All is in it &#8211; the mother,
the boy, you and me and all else. It is one event.
<!--l. 3586--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You mean to say that even our discussing the boy&#8217;s case was
predestined?
<!--l. 3588--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How else? All things contain their future. The boy appears in
consciousness. I am beyond. I do not issue orders to consciousness. I
know that it is in the nature of awareness to set things right.
Let consciousness look after its creations! The boy&#8217;s sorrow,
your pity, my listening and consciousness acting &#8211; all this is
one single fact &#8211; don&#8217;t split it into components and then ask
questions.
<!--l. 3590--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How strangely does your mind work?
<!--l. 3592--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are strange, not me. I am normal. I am sane. I see things as
they are, and therefore l am not afraid of them. But you are afraid of
reality.
<!--l. 3594--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should l?
<!--l. 3596--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is ignorance of yourself that makes you afraid and also unaware
that you are afraid. Don&#8217;t try not to be afraid. Break down the wall of
ignorance first.
<!--l. 3598--><p class="noindent" >People are afraid to die, because they do not know what is death. The
jnani has died before his death, he saw that there was nothing to be
afraid of. The moment you know your real being, you are afraid of
nothing. Death gives freedom and power. To be free in the world, you
must die to the world. Then the universe is your own, it becomes your
body, an expression and a tool. The happiness of being absolutely free
is beyond description. On the other hand, he who is afraid of freedom
cannot die.

<!--l. 3600--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You mean that one who cannot die, cannot live?
<!--l. 3602--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Put it as you like; attachment is bondage, detachment is freedom.
To crave is to slave.
<!--l. 3604--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it follow that if you are saved, the world is saved?
<!--l. 3606--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As a whole the world does not need saving. Man makes mistakes
and creates sorrow; when it enters the field of awareness, the
consciousness of a jnani, it is set right. Such is his nature.
<!--l. 3608--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We can observe what may be called spiritual progress. A selfish man
turns religious, controls himself, refines his thoughts and feelings, takes
to spiritual practice, realises his true being. Is such progress ruled by
causality, or is it accidental?
<!--l. 3610--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>From my point of view everything happens by itself, quite
spontaneously. But man imagines that he works for an incentive,
towards a goal. He has always a reward in mind and strives for
it.
<!--l. 3612--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A crude, unevolved man will not work without a reward. Is it not
right to offer him incentives?
<!--l. 3614--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He will create for himself incentives anyhow. He does not know that
to grow is in the nature of consciousness. He will progress from motive
to motive and will chase Gurus for the fulfilment of his desires. When
by the laws of his being he finds the way of return ( nivritti) he
abandons all motives, for his interest in the world is over. He wants
nothing &#8211; neither from others nor from himself. He dies to all and
becomes the All. To want nothing and do nothing &#8211; that is true
creation! To watch the universe emerging and subsiding in one&#8217;s heart
is a wonder.

<!--l. 3616--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The great obstacle to inner effort is boredom. The disciple gets
bored.
<!--l. 3618--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Inertia and restlessness ( tamas and rajas) work together and keep
clarity and harmony ( sattva) down. Tamas and Rajas must be
conquered before Sattva can appear. It will all come in due course,
quite spontaneously.
<!--l. 3620--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no need of effort then?
<!--l. 3622--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When effort is needed, effort will appear. When effortlessness
becomes essential, it will assert itself. You need not push life about.
Just flow with it and give yourself completely to the task of the present
moment, which is the dying now to the now. For living is dying.
Without death life cannot be.
<!--l. 3624--><p class="noindent" >Get hold of the main thing that the world and the self are one and
perfect. Only your attitude is faulty and needs readjustment.
<!--l. 3626--><p class="noindent" >This process or readjustment is what you call sadhana. You come to it
by putting an end to indolence and using all your energy to clear the
way for clarity and charity. But in reality, these all are signs of
inevitable growth. Don&#8217;t be afraid, don&#8217;t resist, don&#8217;t delay. Be what
you are. There is nothing to be afraid of. Trust and try. Experiment
honestly. Give your real being a chance to shape your life. You will not
regret.

class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I am a Swede by birth. Now I am teaching Hatha Yoga in
Mexico and in the States.
<!--l. 3631--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Where did you learn it?
<!--l. 3633--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I had a teacher in the States, an Indian Swami.
<!--l. 3635--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What did it give you?
<!--l. 3637--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It gave me good health and a means of livelihood.
<!--l. 3639--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Good enough. Is it all you want?
<!--l. 3641--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I seek peace of mind. I got disgusted with all the cruel things done
by the so-called Christians in the name of Christ. For some time I was
without religion. Then I got attracted to Yoga.
<!--l. 3643--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What did you gain?
<!--l. 3645--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I studied the philosophy of Yoga and it did help me.
<!--l. 3647--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In what way did it help you? By what signs did you conclude that
you have been helped?
<!--l. 3649--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Good health is something quite tangible.
<!--l. 3651--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No doubt it is very pleasant to feel fit. Is pleasure all you expected
from Yoga?
<!--l. 3653--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The joy of well-being is the reward of Hatha Yoga. But Yoga in
general yields more than that. It answers many questions.

<!--l. 3655--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What do you mean by Yoga?
<!--l. 3657--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The whole teaching of India &#8211; evolution, re-incarnation, karma and
so on.
<!--l. 3659--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All right, you got all the knowledge you wanted. But in what way
are you benefited by it?
<!--l. 3661--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It gave me peace of mind.
<!--l. 3663--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Did it? Is your mind at peace? Is your search over?
<!--l. 3665--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No, not yet.
<!--l. 3667--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Naturally. There will be no end to it, because there is no such thing
as peace of mind. Mind means disturbance; restlessness itself is
mind. Yoga is not an attribute of the mind, nor is it a state of
mind.
<!--l. 3669--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Some measure of peace I did derive from Yoga.
<!--l. 3671--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Examine closely and you will see that the mind is seething with
thoughts. It may go blank occasionally, but it does it for a time and
reverts to its usual restlessness. A becalmed mind is not a peaceful
mind. You say you want to pacify your mind. Is he, who wants to
pacify the mind, himself peaceful?
<!--l. 3673--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No. I am not at peace, I take the help of Yoga.
<!--l. 3675--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t you see the contradiction? For many years you sought your
peace of mind. You could not find it, for a thing essentially restless
cannot be at peace.
<!--l. 3677--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is some improvement.

<!--l. 3679--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The peace you claim to have found is very brittle any little thing
can crack it. What you call peace is only absence of disturbance. It is
hardly worth the name. The real peace cannot be disturbed. Can you
claim a peace of mind that is unassailable?
<!--l. 3681--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>l am striving.
<!--l. 3683--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Striving too is a form of restlessness.
<!--l. 3685--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So what remains?
<!--l. 3687--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The self does not need to be put to rest. It is peace itself, not at
peace. Only the mind is restless. All it knows is restlessness,
with its many modes and grades. The pleasant are considered
superior and the painful are discounted. What we call progress
is merely a change over from the unpleasant to the pleasant.
But changes by themselves cannot bring us to the changeless,
for whatever has a beginning must have an end. The real does
not begin; it only reveals itself as beginningless and endless,
all-pervading, all-powerful, immovable prime mover, timelessly
changeless.
<!--l. 3689--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So what has one to do?
<!--l. 3691--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Through Yoga you have accumulated knowledge and experience.
This cannot be denied. But of what use is it all to you? Yoga means
union, joining. What have you re-united, re-joined?
<!--l. 3693--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am trying to rejoin the personality back to the real self.
<!--l. 3695--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The personality ( vyakti) is but a product of imagination.
The self ( vyakta) is the victim of this imagination. It is the
taking yourself to be what you are not that binds you. The person
cannot be said to exist on its own rights; it is the self that believes

there is a person and is conscious of being it. Beyond the self (
vyakta) lies the unmanifested ( avyakta), the causeless cause of
everything.
<!--l. 3697--><p class="noindent" >Even to talk of re-uniting the person with the self is not right,
because there is no person, only a mental picture given a false
reality by conviction. Nothing was divided and there is nothing to
unite.
<!--l. 3699--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yoga helps in the search for and the finding of the self.
<!--l. 3701--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can find what you have lost. But you cannot find what you
have not lost.
<!--l. 3703--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Had I never lost anything, I would have been enlightened. But I am
not. I am searching. Is not my very search a proof of my having lost
something?
<!--l. 3705--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It only shows that you believe you have lost. But who believes it?
And what is believed to be lost? Have you lost a person like yourself?
What is the self you are in search of? What exactly do you expect to
find?
<!--l. 3707--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The true knowledge of the self.
<!--l. 3709--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The true knowledge of the self is not a knowledge. It is not
something that you find by searching, by looking everywhere. It is not
to be found in space or time. Knowledge is but a memory, a pattern of
thought, a mental habit. All these are motivated by pleasure and pain.
It is because you are goaded by pleasure and pain that you are in
search of knowledge. Being oneself is completely beyond all motivation.
You cannot be yourself for some reason. You are yourself, and no
reason is needed.

<!--l. 3711--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By doing Yoga I shall find peace.
<!--l. 3713--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Can there be peace apart from yourself? Are you talking from your
own experience or from books only? Your book knowledge is useful to
begin with, but soon it must be given up for direct experience, which
by its very nature is inexpressible. Words can be used for destruction
also; of words images are built, by words they are destroyed. You got
yourself into your present state through verbal thinking; you must get
out of it the same way.
<!--l. 3715--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I did attain a degree of inner peace. Am I to destroy it?
<!--l. 3717--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What has been attained may be lost again. Only when you realise
the true peace, the peace you have never lost, that peace will remain
with you, for it was never away. Instead of searching for what you do
not have, find out what is it that you have never lost? That which is
there before the beginning and after the ending of everything; that to
which there is no birth, nor death. That immovable state, which is not
affected by the birth and death of a body or a mind, that state you
must perceive.
<!--l. 3719--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What are the means to such perception?
<!--l. 3721--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In life nothing can be had without overcoming obstacles. The
obstacles to the clear perception of one&#8217;s true being are desire for
pleasure and fear of pain. It is the pleasure-pain motivation that stands
in the way. The very freedom from all motivation, the state in which no
desire arises is the natural state.
<!--l. 3723--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Such giving up of desires, does it need time?
<!--l. 3725--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you leave it to time, millions of years will be needed. Giving up
desire after desire is a lengthy process with the end never in sight.
Leave alone your desires and fears, give your entire attention

to the subject, to him who is behind the experience of desire
and fear. Ask: &#8216;who desires?&#8217; Let each desire bring you back to
yourself.
<!--l. 3727--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The root of all desires and fears is the same &#8211; the longing for
happiness.
<!--l. 3729--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The happiness you can think of and long for, is mere physical or
mental satisfaction. Such sensory or mental pleasure is not the real, the
absolute happiness.
<!--l. 3731--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even sensory and mental pleasures and the general sense of
well-being which arises with physical and mental health, must have
their roots in reality.
<!--l. 3733--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They have their roots in imagination. A man who is given a stone
and assured that it is a priceless diamond will be mightily pleased until
he realises his mistake; in the same way pleasures lose their tang and
pains their barb when the self is known. Both are seen as they are &#8211;
conditional responses, mere reactions, plain attractions and repulsions,
based on memories or pre-conceptions. Usually pleasure and pain are
experienced when expected. It is all a matter of acquired habits and
convictions.
<!--l. 3735--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Well, pleasure may be imaginary. But pain is real.
<!--l. 3737--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pain and pleasure go always together. Freedom from one means
freedom from both. If you do not care for pleasure, you will not be
afraid of pain. But there is happiness which is neither, which is
completely beyond. The happiness you know is describable and
measurable. It is objective, so to say. But the objective cannot be your
own. It would be a grievous mistake to identify yourself with something
external. This churning up of levels leads nowhere. Reality is beyond
the subjective and objective, beyond all levels, beyond every

distinction. Most definitely it is not their origin, source or root. These
come from ignorance of reality, not from reality itself, which is
indescribable, beyond being and not-being.
<!--l. 3739--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Many teachers have I followed and studied many doctrines, yet none
gave me what I wanted.
<!--l. 3741--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The desire to find the self will be surely fulfilled, provided you
want nothing else. But you must be honest with yourself and
really want nothing else. If in the meantime you want many other
things and are engaged in their pursuit, your main purpose may
be delayed until you grow wiser and cease being torn between
contradictory urges. Go within, without swerving, without ever looking
outward.
<!--l. 3743--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But my desires and fears are still there.
<!--l. 3745--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Where are they but in your memory? realise that their root is
in expectation born of memory and they will cease to obsess
you.
<!--l. 3747--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have understood very well that social service is an endless
task, because improvement and decay, progress and regress, go
side by side. We can see it on all sides and on every level. What
remains?
<!--l. 3749--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whatever work you have undertaken &#8211; complete it. Do not take
up new tasks. unless it is called for by a concrete situation of
suffering and relief from suffering. Find yourself first, and endless
blessings will follow. Nothing profits the world as much as the
abandoning of profits. A man who no longer thinks in terms of
loss and gain is the truly non-violent man, for he is beyond all
conflict.

<!--l. 3751--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, I was always attracted by the idea of ahimsa (non-violence).
<!--l. 3753--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Primarily, ahimsa means what it says: &#8216;don&#8217;t hurt&#8217;. It is not doing
good that comes first, but ceasing to hurt, not adding to suffering.
Pleasing others is not ahimsa.
<!--l. 3755--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am not talking of pleasing, but I am all for helping others.
<!--l. 3757--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The only help worth giving is freeing from the need for further
help. Repeated help is no help at all. Do not talk of helping another,
unless you can put him beyond all need of help.
<!--l. 3759--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one go beyond the need of help? And can one help
another to do so?
<!--l. 3761--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you have understood that all existence, in separation
and limitation, is painful, and when you are willing and able
to live integrally, in oneness with all life, as pure being, you
have gone beyond all need of help. You can help another by
precept and example and, above all, by your being. You cannot
give what you do not have and you don&#8217;t have what you are
not. You can only give what you are &#8211; and of that you can give
limitlessly.
<!--l. 3763--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But, is it true that all existence is painful?
<!--l. 3765--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else can be the cause of this universal search for pleasure?
Does a happy man seek happiness? How restless people are, how
constantly on the move! It is because they are in pain that they seek
relief in pleasure. All the happiness they can imagine is in the
assurance of repeated pleasure.
<!--l. 3767--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If what I am, as I am, the person I take myself to be, cannot be
happy, then what am I to do?

<!--l. 3769--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can only cease to be &#8211; as you seem to be now. There is nothing
cruel in what I say. To wake up a man from a nightmare is compassion.
You came here because you are in pain, and all I say is: wake up, know
yourself, be yourself. The end of pain lies not in pleasure. When you
realise that you are beyond both pain and pleasure, aloof and
unassailable, then the pursuit of happiness ceases and the resultant
sorrow too. For pain aims at pleasure and pleasure ends in pain,
relentlessly.
<!--l. 3771--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In the ultimate state there can be no happiness?
<!--l. 3773--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nor sorrow. Only freedom. Happiness depends on something or
other and can be lost; freedom from everything depends on nothing and
cannot be lost. Freedom from sorrow has no cause and, therefore,
cannot be destroyed. realise that freedom.
<!--l. 3775--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Am I not born to suffer as a result of my past? Is freedom
possible at all? Was I born of my own will? Am I not just a
creature?
<!--l. 3777--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is birth and death but the beginning and the ending of a
stream of events in consciousness? Because of the idea of separation
and limitation they are painful. Momentary relief from pain we call
pleasure &#8211; and we build castles in the air hoping for endless pleasure
which we call happiness. It is all misunderstanding and misuse. Wake
up, go beyond, live really.
<!--l. 3779--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My knowledge is limited, my power negligible.
<!--l. 3781--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Being the source of both. the self is beyond both knowledge and
power. The observable is in the mind. The nature of the self is pure
awareness, pure witnessing, unaffected by the presence or absence of
knowledge or liking.

<!--l. 3783--><p class="noindent" >Have your being outside this body of birth and death and all
your problems will be solved. They exist because you believe
yourself born to die. Undeceive yourself and be free. You are not a
person.

 id="x1-4000035"></a>Greatest Guru is Your Inner Self</h2>
<!--l. 3787--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>On all sides I hear that freedom from desires and
inclinations is the first condition of self-realisation. But I find the
condition impossible of fulfilment. Ignorance of oneself causes desires
and desires perpetuate ignorance. A truly vicious circle!
<!--l. 3789--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>There are no conditions to fulfil. There is nothing to be
done, nothing to be given up. Just look and remember, whatever you
perceive is not you, nor yours. It is there in the field of consciousness,
but you are not the field and its contents, nor even the knower of the
field. It is your idea that you have to do things that entangle you in
the results of your efforts &#8211; the motive, the desire, the failure
to achieve, the sense of frustration &#8211; all this holds you back.
Simply look at whatever happens and know that you are beyond
it.
<!--l. 3791--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it mean I should abstain from doing anything?
<!--l. 3793--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You cannot! What goes on must go on. If you stop suddenly, you
will crash.
<!--l. 3795--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it a matter of the known and the knower becoming one?
<!--l. 3797--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Both are ideas in the mind, and words that express them. There is
no self in them. The self is neither, between nor beyond. To look for it
on the mental level is futile. Stop searching, and see &#8211; it is here and
now &#8211; it is that &#8216;I am&#8217; you know so well. All you need to do is to cease
taking yourself to be within the field of consciousness. Unless you have
already considered these matters carefully, listening to me once will
not do. Forget your past experiences and achievements, stand
naked, exposed to the winds and rains of life and you will have a
chance.

<!--l. 3799--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Has devotion ( bhakti) any place in your teaching?
<!--l. 3801--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you are not well, you go to a physician who tells you
what is wrong and what is the remedy. If you have confidence in
him, it makes things simple: you take the medicine, follow the
diet restrictions and get well. But if you do not trust him, you
may still take a chance, or you may study medicine yourself! In
all cases it is your desire for recovery that moves you, not the
physician.
<!--l. 3803--><p class="noindent" >Without trust there is no peace. Somebody or other you always trust &#8211;
it may be your mother, or your wife. Of all the people the knower of
the self, the liberated man, is the most trust-worthy. But merely
to trust is not enough. You must also desire. Without desire
for freedom of what use is the confidence that you can acquire
freedom? Desire and confidence must go together. The stronger
your desire, the easier comes the help. The greatest Guru is
helpless as long as the disciple is not eager to learn. Eagerness
and earnestness are all-important. Confidence will come with
experience.
<!--l. 3805--><p class="noindent" >Be devoted to your goal &#8211; and devotion to him who can guide you will
follow. If your desire and confidence are strong, they will operate and
take you to your goal, for you will not cause delay by hesitation and
compromise.
<!--l. 3807--><p class="noindent" >The greatest Guru is your inner self. Truly, he is the supreme teacher.
He alone can take you to your goal and he alone meets you at the end
of the road. Confide in him and you need no outer Guru. But again you
must have the strong desire to find him and do nothing that
will create obstacles and delays. And do not waste energy and
time on regrets. Learn from your mistakes and do not repeat
them.

<!--l. 3809--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If you do not mind my asking a personal question...?
<!--l. 3811--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, go ahead.
<!--l. 3813--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I see you sitting on an antelope skin. How does it tally with
non-violence?
<!--l. 3815--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All my working life I was a cigarette-maker, helping people to
spoil their health. And in front of my door the municipality
has put up a public lavatory, spoiling my health. In this violent
world how can one keep away from violence of some kind or
other?
<!--l. 3817--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely all avoidable violence should be avoided. And yet in India
every holy man has his tiger, lion, leopard or antelope skin to sit
on.
<!--l. 3819--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe because no plastics were available in ancient times and a
skin was best to keep the damp away. Rheumatism has no charm, even
for a saint! Thus the tradition arose that for lengthy meditations a skin
is needed. Just like the drum-hide in a temple, so is the antelope skin of
a Yogi.
<!--l. 3821--><p class="noindent" >We hardly notice it.
<!--l. 3823--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But the animal had to be killed.
<!--l. 3825--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I have never heard of a Yogi killing a tiger for his hide. The killers
are not Yogis and the Yogis are not killers.
<!--l. 3827--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Should you not express your disapproval by refusing to sit on a
skin?
<!--l. 3829--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What an idea! I disapprove of the entire universe, why only a

skin?

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is wrong with the universe?
<!--l. 3833--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Forgetting your Self is the greatest injury; all the calamities flow
from it. Take care of the most important, the lesser will take care of
itself. You do not tidy up a dark room. You open the windows first.
Letting in the light makes everything easy. So, let us wait with
improving others until we have seen ourselves as we are &#8211; and have
changed. There is no need to turn round and round in endless
questioning; find yourself and everything will fall into its proper
place.
<!--l. 3835--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The urge to return to the source is very rare. Is it at all natural?
<!--l. 3837--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Outgoing is natural in the beginning, ingoing &#8211; in the end. But
in reality the two are one, just like breathing in and out are
one.
<!--l. 3839--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In the same way are not the body and the dweller in the body
one?
<!--l. 3841--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Events in time and space &#8211; birth and death, cause and effect &#8211;
these may be taken as one; but the body and the embodied are
not of the same order of reality. The body exists in time and
space, transient and limited, while the dweller is timeless and
spaceless, eternal and all-pervading. To identify the two is a grievous
mistake and the cause of endless suffering. You can speak of the
mind and body as one, but the body-mind is not the underlying
reality.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Whoever he may be, the dweller is in control of the body and,
therefore, responsible for it.

<!--l. 3845--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is a universal power which is in control and is responsible.
<!--l. 3847--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And so, I can do as I like and put the blame on some universal
power? How easy!
<!--l. 3849--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, very easy. Just realise the One Mover behind all that moves
and leave all to Him. If you do not hesitate, or cheat, this is the
shortest way to reality. Stand without desire and fear, relinquishing all
control and all responsibility.
<!--l. 3851--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What madness!
<!--l. 3853--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, divine madness. What is wrong in letting go the illusion of
personal control and personal responsibility? Both are in the mind only.
Of course, as long as you imagine yourself to be in control, you
should also imagine yourself to be responsible. One implies the
other.
<!--l. 3855--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can the universal be responsible for the particular?
<!--l. 3857--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All life on earth depends on the sun. Yet you cannot blame
the sun for all that happens, though it is the ultimate cause.
Light causes the colour of the flower, but it neither controls,
nor is responsible for it directly. It makes it possible, that is
all.
<!--l. 3859--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What I do not like in all this is taking refuge in some universal
power.
<!--l. 3861--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You cannot quarrel with facts.
<!--l. 3863--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Whose facts? Yours or mine?
<!--l. 3865--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yours. You cannot deny my facts, for you do not know them. Could

you know them, you would not deny them. Here lies the trouble. You
take your imagining for facts and my facts for imagination.
<!--l. 3867--><p class="noindent" >I know for certain that all is one. Differences do not separate. Either
you are responsible for nothing, or for everything. To imagine that you
are in control and responsible for one body only is the aberration of the
body-mind.
<!--l. 3869--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still, you are limited by your body.
<!--l. 3871--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Only in matters pertaining to the body. This I do not mind. It is
like enduring the seasons of the year. They come, they go &#8211; they hardly
affect me. In the same way body-minds come and go &#8211; life is forever in
search of new expressions.
<!--l. 3873--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As long as you do not put all the burden of evil on God, I am
satisfied. There may be a God for all I know, but to me he is a
concept projected by the human mind. He may be a reality to
you, but to me society is more real than God, for I am both its
creature and its prisoner. Your values are wisdom and compassion;
society&#8217;s sagacious selfishness. I live in a world quite different from
yours.
<!--l. 3875--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>None compels.
<!--l. 3877--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>None compels you, but I am compelled. My world is an evil
world, full of tears, toil and pain. To explain it away by the
intellectualising, by putting forth theories of evolution and karma is
merely adding insult to injury. The God of an evil world is a cruel
God.
<!--l. 3879--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are the god of your world and you are both stupid and cruel.
Let God be a concept &#8211; your own creation. Find out who you are, how
did you come to live, longing for truth, goodness and beauty in a world

full of evil. Of what use is your arguing for or against God. when you
just do not know who is God and what are you talking about. The
God born of fear and hope, shaped by desire and imagination,
cannot be the Power That is, the Mind and the Heart of the
universe.
<!--l. 3881--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I agree that the world I live in and the God I believe in are
both creatures of imagination. But in what way are they created
by desire? Why do I imagine a world so painful and a God so
indifferent?
<!--l. 3883--><p class="noindent" >What is wrong with me that I should torture myself so cruelly? The
enlightened man comes and tells me: &#8216;it is but a dream to put an
end to&#8217;, but is he not himself a part of the dream? I find myself
trapped and see no way out. You say you are free. Of what are you
free? For heaven&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t feed me on words, enlighten me,
help me to wake up, since it is you who sees me tossing in my
sleep.
<!--l. 3885--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When I say I am free, I merely state a fact. If you are an adult, you
are free from infancy. I am free from all description and identification.
Whatever you may hear, see, or think of, I am not that. I am free from
being a percept, or a concept.
<!--l. 3887--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still, you have a body and you depend on it.
<!--l. 3889--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again you assume that your point of view is the only correct one. I
repeat: I was not, am not, shall not be a body. To me this is a fact. I
too was under the illusion of having been born, but my Guru made me
see that birth and death are mere ideas &#8211; birth is merely the idea: &#8216;I
have a body&#8217;.
<!--l. 3891--><p class="noindent" >And death &#8211; &#8216;I have lost my body&#8217;. Now, when I know I am not a body,
the body may be there or may not &#8211; what difference does it make? The

body-mind is like a room. It is there, but I need not live in it all the
time.
<!--l. 3893--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet, there is a body and you do take care of it.
<!--l. 3895--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The power that created the body takes care of it.
<!--l. 3897--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are jumping from level to level all the time.
<!--l. 3899--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There are two levels to consider &#8211; the physical &#8211; of facts, and
mental &#8211; of ideas. I am beyond both. Neither your facts, nor ideas are
mine. What I see is beyond. Cross over to my side and see with
me.
<!--l. 3901--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What I want to say is very simple. As long as I believe: &#8216;I am the
body&#8217;, I must not say: &#8216;God will look after my body&#8217;. God will not. He
will let it starve, sicken and die.
<!--l. 3903--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else do you expect from a mere body? Why are you so
anxious about it?
<!--l. 3905--><p class="noindent" >Because you think you are the body, you want it indestructible. You
can extend its life considerably by appropriate practices, but for what
ultimate good?
<!--l. 3907--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is better to live long and healthy. It gives us a chance to avoid the
mistakes of childhood and youth, the frustrations of adulthood, the
miseries and imbecility of old age.
<!--l. 3909--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means live long. But you are not the master. Can you decide
the days of your birth and death? We are not speaking the same
language. Yours is a make-believe talk, all hangs on suppositions and
assumptions. You speak with assurance about things you are not sure
of.

<!--l. 3911--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Therefore, I am here.
<!--l. 3913--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are not yet here. I am here. Come in! But you don&#8217;t. You want
me to live your life, feel your way, use your language. I cannot, and it
will not help you. You must come to me. Words are of the mind and
the mind obscures and distorts. Hence the absolute need to go beyond
words and move over to my side.
<!--l. 3915--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Take me over.
<!--l. 3917--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am doing it, but you resist. You give reality to concepts, while
concepts are distortions of reality. Abandon all conceptualisation and
stay silent and attentive. Be earnest about it and all will be well with
you.

<!--l. 3921--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>A thousand years ago a man lived and died. His identity (
antahkarana) re-appeared in a new body. Why does he not remember
his previous life? And if he does, can the memory be brought into the
conscious?
<!--l. 3923--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>How do you know that the same person re-appeared in the
new body? A new body may mean a new person altogether.
<!--l. 3925--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Imagine a pot of ghee. (Indian clarified butter). When the pot
breaks, the Ghee remains and can be transferred to another pot. The
old pot had its own scent, the new &#8211; its own. The Ghee will carry the
scents from pot to pot. In the same way the personal identity is
transferred from body to body.
<!--l. 3927--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is all right. When there is the body, its peculiarities affect the
person. Without the body we have the pure identity in the sense of &#8216;I
am&#8217;. But when you are reborn in a new body, where is the world
formerly experienced?
<!--l. 3929--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Every body experiences its own world.
<!--l. 3931--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In the present body the old body &#8211; is it merely an idea, or is it a
memory?
<!--l. 3933--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>An idea, of course. How can a brain remember what it has not
experienced?
<!--l. 3935--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have answered your own question. Why play with ideas? Be
content with what you are sure of. And the only thing you can be
sure of is &#8216;I am&#8217;. Stay with it, and reject everything else. This is
Yoga.

<!--l. 3937--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can reject only verbally. At best I remember to repeat the formula:
&#8216;This is not me, this is not mine. I am beyond all this&#8217;.
<!--l. 3939--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Good enough. First verbally, then mentally and emotionally, then
in action. Give attention to the reality within you and it will come to
light. It is like churning the cream for butter. Do it correctly and
assiduously and the result is sure to come.
<!--l. 3941--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can the absolute be the result of a process?
<!--l. 3943--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are right, the relative cannot result in the absolute. But the
relative can block the absolute, just as the non-churning of the cream
may prevent the butter from separating. It is the real that creates the
urge; the inner prompts the outer and the outer responds in interest
and effort. But ultimately there is no inner, nor outer; the light of
consciousness is both the creator and the creature, the experiencer and
the experience, the body and the embodied. Take care of the
power that projects all this and your problems will come to an
end.
<!--l. 3945--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Which is the projecting power?
<!--l. 3947--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is imagination prompted by desire.

<!--l. 3951--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is wrong with purposeful action?
<!--l. 3955--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It does not apply. In these matters there is no question of purpose,
nor of action. All you need is to listen, remember, ponder. It is like
taking food. All you can do is to bite off, chew and swallow. All else is
unconscious and automatic. Listen, remember and understand &#8211;

the mind is both the actor and the stage. All is of the mind
and you are not the mind. The mind is born and reborn, not
you.
<!--l. 3957--><p class="noindent" >The mind creates the world and all the wonderful variety of it. Just like
in a good play you have all sorts of characters and situations, so you
need a little of everything to make a world.

<!--l. 3961--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 3965--><p class="noindent" ><span

work with Him. It you do not, become one. Either see the world as a
play or work at it with all your might. Or both.
<!--l. 3967--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What about the identify of the dying man? What happens to
it when he is dead? Do you agree that it continues in another
body.
<!--l. 3969--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It continues and yet it does not. All depends how you look at it.
What is identity, after all?
<!--l. 3971--><p class="noindent" >Continuity in memory? Can you talk of identity without memory?
<!--l. 3973--><p class="noindent" ><span

characteristics will be there.
<!--l. 3975--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who identifies them? Somebody with a memory to register
and compare. Don&#8217;t you see that memory is the warp of your
mental life. And identity is merely a pattern of events in time and

space.
<!--l. 3977--><p class="noindent" >Change the pattern and you have changed the man.
<!--l. 3979--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The pattern is significant and important. It has its own value. By
saying that a woven design is merely coloured threads you miss
the most important &#8211; the beauty of it. Or by describing a book
as paper with ink stains on it, you miss the meaning. Identity
is valuable because it is the basis of individuality; that which
makes us unique and irreplaceable. &#8216;I am&#8217;, is the intuition of
uniqueness.
<!--l. 3981--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes and no. Identity, individuality, uniqueness &#8211; they are the most
valuable aspects of the mind, yet of the mind only. &#8216;I am all
there is&#8217; too is an experience equally valid. The particular and
the universal are inseparable. They are the two aspects of the
nameless, as seen from without and from within. Unfortunately,
words only mention, but don&#8217;t convey. Try to go beyond the
words.

<!--l. 4003--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4005--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The other day there was a talk about the use by the jnani of
animal skins for meditation etc. I was not convinced. It is easy to
justify everything by referring to custom and tradition. Customs
may be cruel and tradition corrupt. They explain, but do not
justify.
<!--l. 4007--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I never meant to say that lawlessness follows self-realisation. A
liberated man is extremely law-abiding. But his laws are the laws of his
real self, not of his society. These he observes, or breaks according to
circumstances and necessity. But he will never be fanciful and
disorderly.
<!--l. 4009--><p class="noindent" ><span

from the body-mind&#8217;s. Mine is of the witness. The difference is
basic.

<!--l. 4019--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you look into living process closely, you will find cruelty
everywhere, for life feeds on life. This is a fact, but it does not make
you feel guilty of being alive. You began a life of cruelty by giving your
mother endless trouble. To the last day of your life you will compete for
food, clothing, shelter, holding on to your body, fighting for its needs,
wanting it to be secure, in a world of insecurity and death. From the
animal&#8217;s point of view being killed is not the worst form of dying;
surely preferable to sickness and senile decay. The cruelty lies
in the motive, not in the fact. Killing hurts the killer, not the
killed.
<!--l. 4021--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Agreed; then one must not accept the services of hunters and
butchers.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A man like you should set an example.
<!--l. 4031--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Are you ready to follow my example? I am dead to the world, I
want nothing, not even to live. Be as I am, do as I do. You are judging
me by my clothes and food; while I only look at your motives; if you
believe to be the body and the mind and act on it you are guilty of the
greatest cruelty &#8211; cruelty to your own real being. Compared to it all
other cruelties do not count.
<!--l. 4033--><p class="noindent" >Q; You are taking refuge in the claim that you are not the body. But
you are in control of the body and responsible for all it does. To allow

the body full autonomy would be imbecility, madness!
<!--l. 4035--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Cool down. I am also against all killing of animals for flesh or fur,

not the most urgent; all causes are served best by the man who has

analogy?
<!--l. 4051--><p class="noindent" ><span

No, something is wrong somewhere.

What I say may sound ridiculous. But what the words try to convey is
the highest truth. All is one, however much we quibble. And all is done
to please the one source and goal of every desire. whom we all know as
the &#8216;I am&#8217;.
<!--l. 4059--><p class="noindent" ><span

from pain.

 id="x1-4200037"></a>Beyond Pain and Pleasure there is Bliss</h2>
<!--l. 4081--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You must realise first of all that you are the proof of
everything, including yourself. None can prove your existence, because
his existence must be confirmed by you first. Your being and knowing
you owe nobody. Remember, you are entirely on your own. You do not
come from somewhere, you do not go anywhere. You are timeless being
and awareness.
<!--l. 4083--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>There is a basic difference between us. You know the real
while I know only the workings of my mind. Therefore what you say is
one thing, what I hear is another. What you say is true; what I
understand is false, though the words are the same. There is a gap
between us. How to close the gap?
<!--l. 4085--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Give up the idea of being what you think yourself to be and there
will be no gap. By imagining yourself as separate you have created the
gap. You need not cross it. Just don&#8217;t create it. All is you and yours.
There is nobody else. This is a fact.
<!--l. 4087--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How strange! The very same words which to you are true, to me are
false. &#8216;There is nobody else&#8217;. How obviously untrue!
<!--l. 4089--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Let them be true or untrue. Words don&#8217;t matter. What matters is
the idea you have of yourself, for it blocks you. Give it up.
<!--l. 4091--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>From early childhood I was taught to think that I am limited to my
name and shape. A mere statement to the contrary will not erase the
mental groove. A regular brain-washing is needed &#8211; if at all it can be
done.
<!--l. 4093--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You call it brain-washing, I call it Yoga &#8211; levelling up all the mental
ruts. You must not be compelled to think the same thoughts again and
again. Move on!

<!--l. 4095--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Easier said than done.
<!--l. 4097--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t be childish! Easier to change, than to suffer. Grow out of
your childishness, that is all.
<!--l. 4099--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Such things are not done. They happen.
<!--l. 4101--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everything happens all the time, but you must be ready for it.
Readiness is ripeness. You do not see the real because your mind is not
ready for it.
<!--l. 4103--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If reality is my real nature, how can I ever be unready?
<!--l. 4105--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Unready means afraid. You are afraid of what you are. Your
destination is the whole. But you are afraid that you will lose your
identity. This is childishness, clinging to the toys, to your desires
and fears, opinions and ideas. Give it all up and be ready for
the real to assert itself. This self-assertion is best expressed in
words: &#8216;I am&#8217;. Nothing else has being. Of this you are absolutely
certain
<!--l. 4107--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>&#8216;I am&#8217;, of course, but &#8216;I know&#8217; also. And I know that I am so
and so, the owner of the body, in manifold relations with other
owners.
<!--l. 4109--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is all memory carried over into the now.
<!--l. 4111--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can be certain only of what is now. Past and future, memory and
imagination, these are mental states, but they are all I know and they
are now. You are telling me to abandon them. How does one abandon
the now?
<!--l. 4113--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are moving into the future all the time whether you like it or
not.

<!--l. 4115--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am moving from now into now &#8211; I do not move at all. Everything
else moves &#8211; not me.
<!--l. 4117--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Granted. But your mind does move. In the now you are both the
movable and the immovable.
<!--l. 4119--><p class="noindent" >So far you took yourself to be the movable and overlooked the
immovable. Turn your mind inside out. Overlook the movable and
you will find yourself to be the ever-present, changeless reality,
inexpressible, but solid like a rock.
<!--l. 4121--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If it is now, why am I not aware of it?
<!--l. 4123--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because you hold on to the idea that you are not aware of it. Let go
the idea.
<!--l. 4125--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It does not make me aware.
<!--l. 4127--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Wait. You want to be on both sides of the wall at the same time.
You can, but you must remove the wall. Or realise that the wall and
both sides of it are one single space, to which no idea like &#8216;here&#8217; or
&#8216;there&#8217; applies.
<!--l. 4130--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Similes prove nothing. My only complaint is this: why do I
not see what you see, why your words do not sound true in my
mind. Let me know this much; all else can wait. You are wise and
I am stupid; you see, I don&#8217;t. Where and how shall I find my
wisdom?
<!--l. 4132--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you know yourself to be stupid, you are not stupid at
all!
<!--l. 4134--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Just as knowing myself sick does not make me well, so knowing
myself foolish can not make me wise.

<!--l. 4136--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To know that you are ill must you not be well initially?
<!--l. 4138--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Oh, no. I know by comparison. If I am blind from birth and you tell
me that you know things without touching them, while I must touch to
know, I am aware that I am blind without knowing what does it mean
to see. Similarly, I know that I am lacking something when you assert
things which I cannot grasp. You are telling me such wonderful things
about myself; according to you I am eternal, omnipresent, omniscient,
supremely happy, creator, preserver and destroyer of all there is, the
source of all life, the heart of being, the lord and the beloved
of every creature. You equate me with the Ultimate Reality,
the source and the goal of all existence. I just blink, for I know
myself to be a tiny little bundle of desires and fears, a bubble
of suffering, a transient flash of consciousness in an ocean of
darkness.
<!--l. 4140--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Before pain was, you were. After pain had gone, you remained.
Pain is transient, you are not.
<!--l. 4142--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am sorry, but I do not see what you see. From the day I was born
till the day I die, pain and pleasure will weave the pattern of my life.
Of being before birth and after death I know nothing. I neither
accept nor deny you. I hear what you say, but I do not know
it.
<!--l. 4144--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Now you are conscious, are you not?
<!--l. 4146--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Please do not ask me about before and after. I just know only what
is now.
<!--l. 4148--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Good enough. You are conscious. Hold on to it. There are states
when you are not conscious.
<!--l. 4150--><p class="noindent" >Call it unconscious being.

<!--l. 4152--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Being unconscious?
<!--l. 4154--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness and unconsciousness do not apply here. Existence is
in consciousness, essence is independent of consciousness.
<!--l. 4156--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is void? Is it silence?
<!--l. 4158--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why elaborate? Being pervades and transcends consciousness.
Objective consciousness is a part of pure consciousness, not beyond
it.
<!--l. 4160--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do you come to know a state of pure being which is neither
conscious nor unconscious?
<!--l. 4162--><p class="noindent" >All knowledge is in consciousness only. There may be such a state as
the abeyance of the mind.
<!--l. 4164--><p class="noindent" >Does consciousness then appear as the witness?
<!--l. 4166--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The witness only registers events. In the abeyance of the mind even
the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; dissolves.
<!--l. 4168--><p class="noindent" >There is no &#8216;I am&#8217; without the mind.
<!--l. 4170--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Without the mind means without thoughts. &#8216;I am&#8217; as a thought
subsides. &#8216;I am&#8217; as the sense of being remains.
<!--l. 4172--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All experience subsides with the mind. Without the mind there can
be no experiencer nor experience.
<!--l. 4174--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does not the witness remain?
<!--l. 4176--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The witness merely registers the presence or absence of experience.
It is not an experience by itself, but it becomes an experience when the

thought: &#8216;I am the witness&#8217; arises.
<!--l. 4178--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All I know is that sometimes the mind works and sometimes it
stops. The experience of mental silence I call the abeyance of the
mind.
<!--l. 4180--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Call it silence, or void, or abeyance, the fact is that the three &#8211;
experiencer, experiencing, experience &#8211; are not. In witnessing, in
awareness, self-consciousness, the sense of being this or that, is not.
Unidentified being remains.
<!--l. 4182--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As a state of unconsciousness?
<!--l. 4184--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>With reference to anything, it is the opposite. It is also
between and beyond all opposites. It is neither consciousness nor
unconsciousness, nor midway, nor beyond the two. It is by itself, not
with reference to anything which may be called experience or its
absence.
<!--l. 4186--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How strange! You speak of it as if it were an experience.
<!--l. 4188--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When I think of it &#8211; it becomes an experience.
<!--l. 4190--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Like the invisible light, intercepted by a flower, becoming
colour?
<!--l. 4192--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, you may say so. It is in the colour but not the colour.
<!--l. 4194--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The same old four-fold negation of Nagarjuna: neither this nor that,
nor both, nor either. My mind reels!
<!--l. 4196--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your difficulty stems from the idea that reality is a state of
consciousness, one among many.

<!--l. 4198--><p class="noindent" >You tend to say: &#8221;This is real. That is not real. And this is partly real,
partly unreal&#8221;, as if reality were an attribute or quality to have in
varying measures.
<!--l. 4200--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Let me put it differently. After all, consciousness becomes a problem
only when it is painful. An ever-blissful state does not give rise to
questions. We find all consciousness to be a mixture of the pleasant and
the painful. Why?
<!--l. 4202--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All consciousness is limited and therefore painful. At the root of
consciousness lies desire, the urge to experience.
<!--l. 4204--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you mean to say that without desire there can be no
consciousness? And what is the advantage of being unconscious? If I
have to forego pleasure for the freedom from pain, I better keep
both.
<!--l. 4206--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Beyond pain and pleasure there is bliss.
<!--l. 4208--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Unconscious bliss, of what use is it?
<!--l. 4210--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither conscious nor unconscious. Real.
<!--l. 4212--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is your objection to consciousness?
<!--l. 4214--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is a burden. Body means burden. Sensations, desires, thoughts &#8211;
these are all burdens. All consciousness is of conflict.
<!--l. 4216--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Reality is described as true being, pure consciousness, infinite bliss.
What has pain to do with it?
<!--l. 4218--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pain and pleasure happen, but pain is the price of pleasure,
pleasure is the reward of pain. In life too you often please by hurting
and hurt by pleasing. To know that pain and pleasure are one is

peace.
<!--l. 4220--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All this is very interesting, no doubt, but my goal is more
simple. I want more pleasure and less pain in life. What am I to
do?
<!--l. 4222--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as there is consciousness, there must be pleasure and pain.
It is in the nature of the &#8216;I am&#8217;, of consciousness, to identify itself with
the opposites.
<!--l. 4224--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then of what use is all this to me? It does not satisfy.
<!--l. 4226--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who are you, who is unsatisfied?
<!--l. 4228--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am, the pain-pleasure man.
<!--l. 4230--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pain and pleasure are both ananda (bliss). Here I am sitting in
front of you and telling you &#8211;
<!--l. 4232--><p class="noindent" >from my own immediate and unchanging experience &#8211; pain and
pleasure are the crests and valleys of the waves in the ocean of bliss.
Deep down there is utter fullness.
<!--l. 4234--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is your experience constant?
<!--l. 4236--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is timeless and changeless.
<!--l. 4238--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All I know is desire for pleasure and fear of pain.
<!--l. 4240--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That is what you think about yourself. Stop it. If you cannot break
a habit all at once, consider the familiar way of thinking and
see its falseness. Questioning the habitual is the duty of the
mind.

<!--l. 4242--><p class="noindent" >What the mind created, the mind must destroy. Or realise that there is
no desire outside the mind and stay out.
<!--l. 4244--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Honestly, I distrust this explaining everything as mind-made. The
mind is only an instrument, as the eye is an instrument. Can you say
that perception is creation? I see the world through the window, not in
the window. All you say holds well together because of the common
foundation, but I do not know whether your foundation is in reality, or
only in the mind. I can have only a mental picture of it. What it means
to you I do not know.
<!--l. 4246--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you take your stand in the mind, you will see me in the
mind.
<!--l. 4248--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How inadequate are words for understanding!
<!--l. 4250--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Without words, what is there to understand? The need for
understanding arises from misunderstanding. What I say is true, but to
you it is only a theory. How will you come to know that it is true?
Listen, remember, ponder, visualise, experience. Also apply it in your
daily life. Have patience with me and, above all have patience with
yourself, for you are your only obstacle. The way leads through yourself
beyond yourself. As long as you believe only the particular to be real,
conscious and happy and reject the non-dual reality as something
imagined, an abstract concept, you will find me doling out concepts
and abstractions. But once you have touched the real within your own
being, you will find me describing what for you is the nearest and the
dearest.

<!--l. 4254--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>The Westerners who occasionally come to see you are
faced with a peculiar difficulty.
<!--l. 4256--><p class="noindent" >The very notion of a liberated man, a realised man, a self-knower, a
God-knower, a man beyond the world, is unknown to them. All they
have in their Christian culture is the idea of a saint: a pious man,
law-abiding, God-fearing, fellow-loving, prayerful, sometimes prone to
ecstasies and confirmed by a few miracles. The very idea of a
jnani is foreign to Western culture, something exotic and rather
unbelievable. Even when his existence is accepted, he is looked
at with suspicion, as a case of self-induced euphoria caused by
strange physical postures and mental attitudes. The very idea of a
new dimension in consciousness seems to them implausible and
improbable.
<!--l. 4258--><p class="noindent" >What will help them is the opportunity of hearing a jnani relate his
own experience of realisation, its causes and beginnings, its progress
and attainments and its actual practice in daily life. Much of what
he says may remain strange, even meaningless, yet there will
remain a feeling of reality, an atmosphere of actual experiencing,
ineffable, yet very real, a centre from which an exemplary life can be
lived.
<!--l. 4260--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>The experience may be incommunicable. Can one
communicate an experience?
<!--l. 4262--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, if one is an artist. The essence of art is communication of
feeling, of experience.
<!--l. 4264--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To receive communication, you must be receptive.
<!--l. 4266--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Of course. There must be a receiver. But if the transmitter does not

transmit, of what use is the receiver?
<!--l. 4268--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The jnani belongs to all. He gives himself tirelessly and completely
to whoever comes to him. If he is not a giver, he is not a jnani.
Whatever he has, he shares.
<!--l. 4270--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But can he share what he is?
<!--l. 4272--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You mean, can he make others into jnanis? Yes and no. No, since
jnanis are not made, they realise themselves as such, when they return
to their source, their real nature. I cannot make you into what you
already are. All I can tell you is the way I travelled and invite you to
take it.
<!--l. 4274--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This does not answer my question. I have in mind the critical and
sceptical Westerner who denies the very possibility of higher states of
consciousness. Recently drugs have made a breach in his disbelief,
without affecting his materialistic outlook. Drugs or no drugs, the body
remains the primary fact and the mind is secondary. Beyond the mind,
they see nothing. From Buddha onwards the state of self-realisation
was described in negative terms, as &#8216;not this, not that&#8217;. Is it inevitable?
Is it not possible to illustrate it, if not describe. I admit, no verbal
description will do, when the state described is beyond words. Yet it is
also within words. Poetry is the art of putting into words the
inexpressible.
<!--l. 4276--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no lack of religious poets. Turn to them for what you
want. As far as I am concerned, my teaching is simple: trust me for a
while and do what I tell you. If you persevere, you will find that your
trust was justified.
<!--l. 4278--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what to do with people who are interested, but cannot
trust?

<!--l. 4280--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If they could stay with me, they would come to trust me.
Once they trust me, they will follow my advice and discover for
themselves.
<!--l. 4282--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is not for the training that I am asking just now, but for its
results. You had both. You are willing to tell us all about the training,
but when it comes to results, you refuse to share. Either you tell us
that your state is beyond words, or that there is no difference; that
where we see a difference, you see none. In both cases we are left
without any insight into your state.
<!--l. 4284--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can you have insight into my state when you are without
insight into your own? When the very instrument of insight is
lacking, is it not important to find it first? It is like a blind man
wanting to learn painting before he regains his eyesight. You want
to know my state &#8211; but do you know the state of your wife or
servant?
<!--l. 4286--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am asking for some hints only.
<!--l. 4288--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Well, I gave you a very significant clue &#8211; where you see differences,
I don&#8217;t. To me it is enough.
<!--l. 4290--><p class="noindent" >If you think it is not enough, I can only repeat; it is enough. Think it
out deeply and you will come to see what I see. You seem to want
instant insight, forgetting that the instant is always preceded by a long
preparation. The fruit falls suddenly, but the ripening takes time. After
all, when I talk of trusting me, it is only for a short time, just
enough time to start you moving. The more earnest you are,
the less belief you need, for soon you will find your faith in me
justified. You want me to prove to you that I am trustworthy! How
can I and why should l? After all, what I am offering you is the
operational approach, so current in Western science. When a scientist
describes an experiment and its results, usually you accept his

statements on trust and repeat his experiment as he describes
it.
<!--l. 4292--><p class="noindent" >Once you get the same or similar results, you need not trust him any
more; you trust your own experience. Encouraged, you proceed and
arrive in the end at substantially identical results.
<!--l. 4294--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The Indian mind was made ready for metaphysical experiments by
culture and nurture. To the Indian words like &#8216;direct perception of the
Supreme Reality&#8217; make sense and bring out responses from the very
depths of his being. They mean little to a Westerner; even when
brought up in his own variety of Christianity, he does not think beyond
conformity with God&#8217;s commandments and Christ&#8217;s injunctions.
First-hand knowledge of reality is not only beyond ambition, but also
beyond conceiving.

iron determination to overcome all obstacles, the Westerner has the

<!--l. 4310--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4316--><p class="noindent" ><span

sharing. Who is willing to take what I am willing to give?

Otherwise there is no difference between the two. The one that sees
knows that with a little attention the other will also see, but the
question of sharing does not arise. Believe me, I am not close-fisted,
holding back your share of reality. On the contrary, I am all
yours, eat me and drink me. But while you repeat verbally: &#8216;give,
give&#8217;, you do nothing to take what is offered. I am showing you a
short and easy way to being able to see what I see, but you
cling to your old habits of thought, feeling and action and put
all the blame on me. I have nothing which you do not have.
Self-knowledge is not a piece of property to be offered and accepted. It
is a new dimension altogether, where there is nothing to give or
take.

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why not? It is the urge, the hidden motive that matters, not the

truth. Only be earnest and honest. The shape it takes hardly
matters.

<!--l. 4361--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4365--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The very facts of repetition, of struggling on and on and of
endurance and perseverance, in spite of boredom and despair and
complete lack of conviction are really crucial. They are not important

must be a push from within and pull from without.
<!--l. 4367--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My questions are typical of the West. There people think in terms
of cause and effect, means and goals. They do not see what causal
connection can there be between a particular word and the Absolute
Reality.
<!--l. 4369--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>None whatsoever. But there is a connection between the word and
its meaning, between the action and its motive. Spiritual practice is
will asserted and re-asserted. Who has not the daring will not accept
the real even when offered. Unwillingness born out of fear is the only
obstacle.
<!--l. 4371--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is there to be afraid of?
<!--l. 4373--><p class="noindent" ><span

beyond.
<!--l. 4375--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4387--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Meet your own self. Be with your own self, listen to it, obey it,
cherish it, keep it in mind ceaselessly. You need no other guide. As long
as your urge for truth affects your daily life, all is well with you. Live
your life without hurting anybody. Harmlessness is a most powerful
form of Yoga and it will take you speedily to your goal. This is what I
call nisarga yoga, the Natural yoga. It is the art of living in peace and
harmony, in friendliness and love. The fruit of it is happiness, uncaused
and endless.
<!--l. 4389--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4391--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4399--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>And this is exactly what I want you to do! Be interested, give
attention, until a current of mutual understanding is established. Then
the sharing will be easy. As a matter of fact, all realisation is only
sharing. You enter a wider consciousness and share in it. Unwillingness
to enter and to share is the only hindrance. I never talk of differences,
for to me there are none. You do, so it is up to you to show
them to me. By all means, show me the differences. For this
you will have to understand me, but then you will no longer
talk of differences. Understand one thing well, and you have
arrived.
<!--l. 4401--><p class="noindent" >What prevents you from knowing is not the lack of opportunity, but
the lack of ability to focus in your mind what you want to understand.
If you could but keep in mind what you do not know, it would reveal
to you its secrets. But if you are shallow and impatient, not
earnest enough to look and wait, you are like a child crying for the
moon.

<!--l. 4439--><p class="noindent" ><span

enough, they must be experienced.
<!--l. 4441--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing stops you but preoccupation with the outer which prevents
you from focussing the inner. It cannot be helped, you cannot skip your
sadhana. You have to turn away from the world and go within, until
the inner and the outer merge and you can go beyond the conditioned,

whether inner or outer.
<!--l. 4443--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, the unconditioned is merely an idea in the conditioned mind.
By itself it has no existence.
<!--l. 4445--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By itself nothing has existence. Everything needs its own absence.
To be, is to be distinguishable, to be here and not there, to be now and
not then, to be thus and not otherwise. Like water is shaped by the
container, so is everything determined by conditions ( gunas). As water
remains water regardless of the vessels, as light remains itself
regardless of the colours it brings out, so does the real remain real,
regardless of conditions in which it is reflected. Why keep the
reflection only in the focus of consciousness? Why not the real
itself?
<!--l. 4447--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Consciousness itself is a reflection. How can it hold the real?
<!--l. 4449--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To know that consciousness and its content are but reflections,
changeful and transient, is the focussing of the real. The refusal to see
the snake in the rope is the necessary condition for seeing the
rope.
<!--l. 4451--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Only necessary, or also sufficient?
<!--l. 4453--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>One must also know that a rope exists and looks like a snake.
Similarly, one must know that the real exists and is of the nature of
witness-consciousness. Of course it is beyond the witness, but to enter
it one must first realise the state of pure witnessing. The awareness of
conditions brings one to the unconditioned.
<!--l. 4455--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can the unconditioned be experienced?
<!--l. 4457--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To know the conditioned as conditioned is all that can be
said about the unconditioned. Positive terms are mere hints and

misleading.
<!--l. 4459--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can we talk of witnessing the real?
<!--l. 4461--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can we? We can talk only of the unreal, the illusory, the
transient, the conditioned. To go beyond, we must pass through total
negation of everything as having independent existence. All things
depend.
<!--l. 4463--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>On what do they depend?
<!--l. 4465--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On consciousness. And consciousness depends on the witness.
<!--l. 4467--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And the witness depends on the real?
<!--l. 4469--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The witness is the reflection of the real in all its purity. It depends
on the condition of the mind.
<!--l. 4471--><p class="noindent" >Where clarity and detachment predominate, the witness-consciousness
comes into being. It is just like saying that where the water is clear and
quiet, the image of the moon appears. Or like daylight that appears as
sparkle in the diamond.
<!--l. 4473--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can there be consciousness without the witness?
<!--l. 4475--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Without the witness it becomes unconsciousness, just living. The
witness is latent in every state of consciousness, just like light in every
colour. There can be no knowledge without the knower and no knower
without his witness. Not only you know, but you know that you
know.
<!--l. 4477--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If the unconditioned cannot be experienced, for all experience is
conditioned, then why talk of it at all?

<!--l. 4479--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can there be knowledge of the conditioned without the
unconditioned? There must be a source from which all this flows,
a foundation on which all stands. Self-realisation is primarily
the knowledge of one&#8217;s conditioning and the awareness that the
infinite variety of conditions depends on our infinite ability to be
conditioned and to give rise to variety. To the conditioned mind the
unconditioned appears as the totality as well as the absence of
everything. Neither can be directly experienced, but this does not make
it not-existent.
<!--l. 4481--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it not a feeling?
<!--l. 4483--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A feeling too is a state of mind. Just like a healthy body does not
call for attention, so is the unconditioned free from experience. Take
the experience of death. The ordinary man is afraid to die, because he
is afraid of change. The jnani is not afraid because his mind is dead
already. He does not think: &#8216;I live&#8217;. He knows: &#8216;There is life&#8217;.
There is no change in it and no death. Death appears to be a
change in time and space. Where there is neither time nor space,
how can there be death? The jnani is already dead to name and
shape. How can their loss affect him? The man in the train travels
from place to place, but the man off the train goes nowhere,
for he is not bound for a destination. He has nowhere to go,
nothing to do, nothing to become. Those who make plans will be
born to carry them out. Those who make no plans need not be
born.

just happens when we are absent-minded. It appears exactly
as it looks, but there is no depth in it, nor meaning. Only the
onlooker is real. Call him Self or Atma. To the Self the world is
but a colourful show, which he enjoys as long as it lasts and
forgets when it is over. Whatever happens on the stage makes him

nature and that he need not do anything, nor strive for anything to
secure it. It follows him, more real than the body, nearer than the mind
itself. You imagine that without cause there can be no happiness. To
me dependence on anything for happiness is utter misery. Pleasure and
pain have causes, while my state is my own, totally uncaused,
independent, unassailable.

Obsessed with the idea of means and end, of work and purpose, you see
me apparently functioning. In reality I only look.
<!--l. 4537--><p class="noindent" >Whatever is done, is done on the stage. Joy and sorrow life and death,

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are all getting old. Old age is not pleasant &#8211; all aches and pains,
weakness and the approaching end. How does a jnani feel as an old
man? How does his inner self look at his own senility.
<!--l. 4543--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As he gets older he grows more and more happy and peaceful. After
all, he is going home. Like a traveller nearing his destination and
collecting his luggage, he leaves the train without regret.
<!--l. 4545--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely there is a contradiction. We are told the jnani is beyond all
change. His happiness neither grows nor wanes. How can he grow
happier because older, and that in spite of physical weakness and so
on?
<!--l. 4547--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no contradiction. The reel of destiny is coming to its end &#8211;

the mind is happy. The mist of bodily existence is lifting &#8211; the burden
of the body is growing less from day to day.
<!--l. 4549--><p class="noindent" ><span

aches and burns. What is his state of mind?
<!--l. 4551--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Every sensation is contemplated in perfect equanimity. There is no
desire for it, nor refusal. It is as it is and then he looks at it with a
smile of affectionate detachment.
<!--l. 4553--><p class="noindent" ><span

there.
<!--l. 4555--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is there, but it does not matter. Whatever state I am in, I see it
as a state of mind to be accepted as it is.

<!--l. 4559--><p class="noindent" ><span

you feel?
<!--l. 4563--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Just as I feel now. You keep on insisting that my inner state is
moulded by outer events. It is just not so. Whatever happens, I remain.
At the root of my being is pure awareness, a speck of intense light. This
speck, by its very nature, radiates and creates pictures in space and
events in time &#8211;
<!--l. 4565--><p class="noindent" >effortlessly and spontaneously. As long as it is merely aware there are
no problems. But when the discriminative mind comes into being and
creates distinctions, pleasure and pain arise. During sleep the mind is

in abeyance and so are pain and pleasure. The process of, creation
continues, but no notice is taken. The mind is a form of consciousness,
and consciousness is an aspect of life. Life creates everything but the
Supreme is beyond all.
<!--l. 4567--><p class="noindent" ><span

consciousness the Supreme is both creation and dissolution, concretion

<!--l. 4573--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4579--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I shall tell you how my Guru&#8217;s Guru died. After announcing that
his end was nearing, he stopped eating, without changing the routine of
his daily life. On the eleventh day, at prayer time he was singing and
clapping vigorously and suddenly died! Just like that, between two
movements, like a blown out candle. Everybody dies as he lives. I am
not afraid of death, because I am not afraid of life. I live a happy life
and shall die a happy death. Misery is to be born, not to die. All
depends how you look at it.
<!--l. 4581--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4587--><p class="noindent" ><span

your very waking up.
<!--l. 4589--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4597--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of thinking that you were born and will die, that you are a body
displaying a mind and all such nonsense. In my world nobody is born
and nobody dies. Some people go on a journey and come back, some
never leave. What difference does it make since they travel in dream
lands, each wrapped up in his own dream. Only the waking up is
important. It is enough to know the &#8216;I am&#8217; as reality and also
love.
<!--l. 4599--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My approach is not so absolute, hence my question. Throughout the
West people are in search of something real. They turn to science,
which tells them a lot about matter, a little about the mind and
nothing about the nature and purpose of consciousness. To them reality
is objective, outside the observable and describable, directly or by
inference; about the subjective aspect of reality they know nothing. It
is extremely important to let them know that there is reality and it is
to be found in the freedom of consciousness from matter and

its limitations and distortions. Most of the people in the world
just do not know that there is reality which can be found and
experienced in consciousness. It seems very important that they
should hear the good news from somebody who has actually
experienced. Such witnesses have always existed and their testimony is
precious.
<!--l. 4601--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. The gospel of self-realisation, once heard, will never be
forgotten. Like a seed left in the ground, it will wait for the right season
and sprout and grow into a mighty tree.

work and rest? What proof is there of his state as different from
ours?
<!--l. 4606--><p class="noindent" >Apart from the verbal testimony of the so-called realised people, is
there no way of verifying their state objectively. Are there not some

<!--l. 4608--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You may find differences, or you may not. All depends on
your capacity of observation.
<!--l. 4610--><p class="noindent" >The objective differences are however, the least important. What
matters is their outlook, their attitude, which is that of total
detachment, aloofness, standing apart.
<!--l. 4612--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does not a jnani feel sorrow when his child dies, does he not
suffer?
<!--l. 4614--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He suffers with those who suffer. The event itself is of little
importance, but he is full of compassion for the suffering being,
whether alive or dead, in the body or out of it. After all, love and
compassion are his very nature. He is one with all that lives and love is
that oneness in action.
<!--l. 4616--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4618--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The jnani is afraid of nothing. But he pities the man who is afraid.
After all to be born, to live and to die is natural. To be afraid is not.
To the event, of course, attention is given.

<!--l. 4620--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Imagine you are ill &#8211; high fever, aches, shivers. The doctor tells you
the condition is serious, there are only a few days to live. What would

commotion is meaningless, for I am not the entity that imagines itself
alive or dead. I am neither born nor can I die. I have nothing to
remember or to forget.

<!--l. 4632--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means pray for the dead. It pleases them very much. They
are flattered. The jnani does not need your prayers. He is himself the
answer to your prayers.
<!--l. 4634--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does the jnani fare after death?
<!--l. 4636--><p class="noindent" ><span

jnani.
<!--l. 4640--><p class="noindent" ><span

reaches the highest goal.

<!--l. 4642--><p class="noindent" >Then only his heart rejoices. All else is of no concern. The entire
universe is his body, all life is his life. As in a city of lights, when one
bulb burns out, it does not affect the network, so the death of a body
does not affect the whole
<!--l. 4644--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The particular may not matter to the whole, but it does matter to
the particular. The whole is an abstraction, the particular, the
concrete, is real.
<!--l. 4646--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That is what you say. To me it may be the other way &#8211; the whole is
real, the part comes and goes. The particular is born and reborn,
changing name and shape, the jnani is the Changeless Reality, which
makes the changeful possible. But he cannot give you the conviction. It
must come with your own experience. With me all is one, all is
equal.

<!--l. 4650--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4658--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Anything you do for the sake of enlightenment takes you nearer.
Anything you do without remembering enlightenment puts you off. But
why complicate? Just know that you are above and beyond all things

mind.

<!--l. 4666--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4672--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Buddha said that the idea of enlightenment is extremely important.
Most people go through their lives not even knowing that there is such
a thing as enlightenment, leave alone the striving for it. Once they have
heard of it, a seed was sown which cannot die. Therefore, he would
send his bhikhus to preach ceaselessly for eight months every
year.

can take it away from you.

mad.

<!--l. 4680--><p class="noindent" >Let them be as they are. I am as I am, for no merit of mine and they
are as they are, for no fault of theirs. The Supreme Reality manifests
itself in innumerable ways. Infinite in number are its names and shapes.
All arise, all merge in the same ocean, the source of all is one. Looking
for causes and results is but the pastime of the mind. What is, is
lovable. Love is not a result, it is the very ground of being. Wherever
you go, you will find being, consciousness and love. Why and what for
make preferences?
<!--l. 4682--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When by natural causes thousands and millions of lives are
extinguished (as it happens in floods and earthquakes), I do not grieve.
But when one man dies at the hand of man, I grieve extremely. The
inevitable has its own majesty, but killing is avoidable and, therefore,
ugly and altogether horrible.
<!--l. 4684--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can anything be without cause?
<!--l. 4688--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In every event the entire universe is reflected. The ultimate cause is
untraceable. The very idea of causation is only a way of thinking and
speaking. We cannot imagine, uncaused emergence.

is it so perverse?
<!--l. 4694--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The causes of perversity are also natural &#8211; heredity, environment
and so on. You are too quick to condemn. Do not worry about others.
Deal with your own mind first. When you realise that your mind too is

a part of nature, the duality will cease.
<!--l. 4696--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is some mystery in it which I cannot fathom. How can the
mind be a part of nature?
<!--l. 4698--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because nature is in the mind; without the mind where is
nature?
<!--l. 4700--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If nature is in the mind and the mind is my own, I should be able to

determine my behaviour.
<!--l. 4702--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4706--><p class="noindent" ><span

it.
<!--l. 4708--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4710--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4712--><p class="noindent" >The new does not care for verbal explanations &#8211; it accepts things as

<!--l. 4714--><p class="noindent" ><span

habitual and the spiritual. What is the attitude of the new self to the
old?
<!--l. 4716--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The new just looks at the old. It is neither friendly nor inimical. It
just accepts the old self along with everything else. It does not deny its
being, but does not accept its value and validity.
<!--l. 4718--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The new is the total denial of the old. The permissive new is not
really new. It is but a new attitude of the old. The really new
obliterates the old completely. The two cannot be together. Is there a
process of self-denudation, a constant refusal to accept the old ideas
and values, or is there just a mutual tolerance? What is their
relation?
<!--l. 4720--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is no particular relation. They co-exist.
<!--l. 4722--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you talk of the old self and new, whom do you have in mind?

As there is continuity in memory between the two, each remembering
the other, how can you speak of two selves?
<!--l. 4724--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>One is a slave to habits, the other is not. One conceptualises, the
other is free from all ideas.
<!--l. 4726--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why two selves? Between the bound and the free there can be no
relationship. The very fact of co-existence proves their basic unity.
There is but one self &#8211; it is always now. What you call the other self &#8211;
old or new &#8211; is but a modality, another aspect of the one self. The self
is single. You are that self and you have ideas of what you have
been or will be. But an idea is not the self. Just now, as you
are sitting in front of me, which self are you? The old or the

<!--l. 4728--><p class="noindent" ><span

Conflict is the characteristic of the old. When the new emerges the old
is no longer. You cannot speak of the new and the conflict in the same
breath. Even the effort of striving for the new self is of the old.
Wherever there is conflict, effort, struggle, striving, longing for a
change, the new is not. To what extent are you free from the habitual
tendency to create and perpetuate conflicts?
<!--l. 4732--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I cannot say that I am now a different man. But I did discover new
things about myself, states so unlike what I knew before that I feel
justified in calling them new.
<!--l. 4734--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The old self is your own self. The state which sprouts suddenly and
without cause, carries no stain of self; you may call it &#8216;god&#8217;. What is
seedless and rootless, what does not sprout and grow, flower and fruit,
what comes into being suddenly and in full glory, mysteriously and
marvellously, you may call that &#8216;god&#8217;. It is entirely unexpected yet

inevitable, infinitely familiar yet most surprising, beyond all hope yet
absolutely certain. Because it is without cause, it is without hindrance.
It obeys one law only; the law of freedom. Anything that implies a
continuity, a sequence, a passing from stage to stage cannot
be the real. There is no progress in reality, it is final, perfect,
unrelated.
<!--l. 4736--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I bring it about?
<!--l. 4738--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can do nothing to bring it about, but you can avoid creating
obstacles. Watch your mind, how it comes into being, how it
operates. As you watch your mind, you discover your self as
the watcher. When you stand motionless, only watching, you
discover your self as the light behind the watcher. The source of
light is dark, unknown is the source of knowledge. That source
alone is. Go back to that source and abide there. It is not in
the sky nor in the all-pervading ether. God is all that is great
and wonderful; I am nothing, have nothing, can do nothing. Yet
all comes out of me &#8211; the source is me; the root, the origin is
me.
<!--l. 4740--><p class="noindent" >When reality explodes in you, you may call it experience of God. Or,

yourself. Reality is not the result of a process; it is an explosion. It is
definitely beyond the mind, but all you can do is to know your
mind well. Not that the mind will help you, but by knowing your
mind you may avoid your mind disabling you. You have to be
very alert, or else your mind will play false with you. It is like
watching a thief &#8211; not that you expect anything from a thief,
but you do not want to be robbed. In the same way you give a
lot of attention to the mind without expecting anything from
it.
<!--l. 4742--><p class="noindent" >Or, take another example. We wake and we sleep. After a day&#8217;s

work sleep comes. Now, do I go to sleep or does inadvertence &#8211;
characteristic of the sleeping state &#8211; come to me? In other words
&#8211;
<!--l. 4744--><p class="noindent" >we are awake because we are asleep. We do not wake up into a really
waking state. In the waking state the world emerges due to ignorance
and takes one into a waking-dream state. Both sleep and waking are
misnomers. We are only dreaming. True waking and true sleeping only
the jnani knows.
<!--l. 4746--><p class="noindent" >We dream that we are awake, we dream that we are asleep. The three
states are only varieties of the dream state. Treating everything as a
dream liberates. As long as you give reality to dreams, you are
their slave. By imagining that you are born as so-and-so, you
become a slave to the so-and-so. The essence of slavery is to
imagine yourself to be a process, to have past and future, to have
history. In fact, we have no history, we are not a process, we do
not develop, nor decay; also see all as a dream and stay out of
it.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What benefit do I derive from listening to you?
<!--l. 4750--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am calling you back to yourself. All I ask you is to look at
yourself, towards yourself, into yourself.
<!--l. 4752--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To what purpose?
<!--l. 4754--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You live, you feel, you think. By giving attention to your
living, feeling and thinking, you free yourself from them and go
beyond them. Your personality dissolves and only the witness
remains.
<!--l. 4756--><p class="noindent" >Then you go beyond the witness. Do not ask how it happens. Just
search within yourself.

<!--l. 4758--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What makes the difference between the person and the witness?
<!--l. 4760--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Both are modes of consciousness. In one you desire and fear, in the
other you are unaffected by pleasure and pain and are not ruffled by
events. You let them come and go.
<!--l. 4762--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one get established in the higher state, the state of pure
witnessing?
<!--l. 4764--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness does not shine by itself. It shines by a light beyond
it. Having seen the dreamlike quality of consciousness, look for the light
in which it appears, which gives it being. There is the content of
consciousness as well as the awareness of it.
<!--l. 4766--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I know and I know that I know.
<!--l. 4768--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite so, provided the second knowledge is unconditional and
timeless. Forget the known, but remember that you are the knower.
Don&#8217;t be all the time immersed in your experiences. Remember that
you are beyond the experience ever unborn and deathless. In
remembering it, the quality of pure knowledge will emerge, the light of
unconditional awareness.
<!--l. 4770--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>At what point does one experience reality?
<!--l. 4772--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Experience is of change, it comes and goes. Reality is not an event,
it cannot be experienced. It is not perceivable in the same way as an
event is perceivable. If you wait for an event to take place, for the
coming of reality, you will wait for ever, for reality neither comes nor
goes. It is to be perceived, not expected. It is not to be prepared for
and anticipated. But the very longing and search for reality is
the movement, operation, action of reality. All you can do is to
grasp the central point, that reality is not an event and does not
happen and whatever happens, whatever comes and goes, is not

reality. See the event as event only, the transient as transient,
experience as mere experience and you have done all you can. Then
you are vulnerable to reality, no longer armoured against it,
as you were when you gave reality to events and experiences.
But as soon as there is some like or dislike, you have drawn a
screen.
<!--l. 4774--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Would you say that reality expresses itself in action rather than in
knowledge? Or, is it a feeling of sorts?
<!--l. 4776--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither action, nor feeling, nor thought express reality. There is no
such thing as an expression of reality. You are introducing a
duality where there is none. Only reality is, there is nothing
else.
<!--l. 4778--><p class="noindent" >The three states of waking, dreaming and sleeping are not me and I am
not in them. When I die, the world will say &#8211; &#8216;Oh, Maharaj is dead!&#8217;
But to me these are words without content; they have no meaning.
When the worship is done before the image of the Guru, all
takes place as if he wakes and bathes and eats and rests, and
goes for a stroll and returns, blesses all and goes to sleep. All is
attended to in minutest details and yet there is a sense of unreality
about it all. So is the case with me. All happens as it needs, yet
nothing happens. I do what seems to be necessary, but at the same
time I know that nothing is necessary, that life itself is only a
make-belief.
<!--l. 4780--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why then live at all? Why all this unnecessary coming and going,
waking and sleeping, eating and digesting?
<!--l. 4782--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing is done by me, everything just happens I do not expect, I
do not plan, I just watch events happening, knowing them to be
unreal.

<!--l. 4784--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Were you always like this from the first moment of enlightenment?
<!--l. 4786--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The three states rotate as usual &#8211; there is waking and sleeping and
waking again, but they do not happen to me. They just happen.
To me nothing ever happens. There is something changeless,
motionless, immovable, rocklike, unassailable; a solid mass of pure
being-consciousness-bliss. I am never out of it. Nothing can take me out
of it, no torture, no calamity.
<!--l. 4788--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet, you are conscious!
<!--l. 4790--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes and no. There is peace &#8211; deep, immense, unshakeable. Events
are registered in memory, but are of no importance. I am hardly aware
of them.
<!--l. 4792--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I understand you rightly, this state did not come by cultivation.
<!--l. 4794--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There was no coming. It was so &#8211; always. There was discovery and
it was sudden. Just as at birth you discover the world suddenly, as
suddenly I discovered my real being.
<!--l. 4796--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Was it clouded over and your sadhana dissolved the mist?
When your true state became clear to you, did it remain clear,
or did it get obscured again? Is your condition permanent or
intermittent?
<!--l. 4798--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Absolutely steady. Whatever I may do, it stays like a rock &#8211;
motionless. Once you have awakened into reality, you stay in it. A child
does not return to the womb! It is a simple state, smaller than the
smallest, bigger than the biggest. It is self-evident and yet beyond
description.
<!--l. 4800--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there a way to it?

<!--l. 4802--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everything can become a way, provided you are interested. Just
puzzling over my words and trying to grasp their full meaning is a
sadhana quite sufficient for breaking down the wall. Nothing troubles
me. I offer no resistance to trouble &#8211; therefore it does not stay with me.
On your side there is so much trouble. On mine there is no trouble at
all. Come to my side. You are trouble-prone. I am immune. Anything
may happen &#8211; what is needed is sincere interest. Earnestness does
it.
<!--l. 4804--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can I do it?
<!--l. 4806--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. You are quite capable of crossing over. Only be
sincere.

<!--l. 4810--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>From year to year your teaching remains the same. There
seems to be no progress in what you tell us.
<!--l. 4812--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>In a hospital the sick are treated and get well. The
treatment is routine, with hardly any change, but there is nothing
monotonous about health. My teaching may be routine, but the fruit of
it is new from man to man.
<!--l. 4814--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is realisation? Who is a realised man? By what is the jnani
recognised?
<!--l. 4816--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There are no distinctive marks of jnana. Only ignorance can be
recognised, not jnana. Nor does a jnani claim to be something special.
AII those who proclaim their own greatness and uniqueness are not
jnanis. They are mistaking some unusual development for realisation.
The jnani shows no tendency to proclaim himself to be a jnani. He
considers himself to be perfectly normal, true to his real nature.
Proclaiming oneself to be an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipotent
deity is a clear sign of ignorance.
<!--l. 4818--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can the jnani convey his experience to the ignorant? Can jnana be
transmitted from one man to another?
<!--l. 4820--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, it can. The words of a jnani have the power of dispelling
ignorance and darkness in the mind. It is not the words that matter,
but the power behind them.
<!--l. 4822--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is that power?
<!--l. 4824--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The power of conviction, based on personal realisation, on one&#8217;s
own direct experience.

<!--l. 4826--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Some realised people say that knowledge must be won, not got.
Another can only teach, but the learning is one&#8217;s own.
<!--l. 4828--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It comes to the same.
<!--l. 4830--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There are many who have practiced Yoga for years and years
without any result. What may be the cause of their failure?
<!--l. 4832--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Some are addicted to trances, with their consciousness in
abeyance. Without full consciousness what progress can there
be?
<!--l. 4834--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Many are practicing samadhis (states of rapturous absorption). In
samadhis consciousness is quite intense, yet they do not result in
anything.
<!--l. 4836--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What results do you expect? And why should jnana be the result of
anything? One thing leads to another, but jnana is not a thing to be
bound by causes and results. It is beyond causality altogether. It is
abidance in the self. The Yogi comes to know many wonders, but of the
self he remains ignorant. The jnani may look and feel quite ordinary,
but the self he knows well.
<!--l. 4838--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There are many who strive for self-knowledge earnestly, but with
scant results. What may be the cause of it?
<!--l. 4840--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They have not investigated the sources of knowledge sufficiently,
their sensations, feelings and thoughts they do not know well enough.
This may be one cause of delay. The other: some desires may still be
alive.
<!--l. 4842--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Ups and downs in sadhana are inevitable. Yet the earnest
seeker plods on in spite of all. What can the jnani do for such a
seeker?

<!--l. 4844--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If the seeker is earnest, the light can be given. The light is for all
and always there, but the seekers are few, and among those few,
those who are ready are very rare. Ripeness of heart and mind is
indispensable.
<!--l. 4846--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Did you get your own realisation through effort or by the grace of
your Guru?
<!--l. 4848--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>His was the teaching and mine was the trust. My confidence in
him made me accept his words as true, go deep into them, live
them, and that is how I came to realise what I am. The Guru&#8217;s
person and words made me trust him and my trust made them
fruitful.
<!--l. 4850--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But can a Guru give realisation without words, without trust, just
like this, without any preparation?
<!--l. 4852--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, one can, but where is the taker? You see, I was so attuned to
my Guru, so completely trusting him. there was so little of resistance in
me, that it all happened easily and quickly. But not everybody is so
fortunate. Laziness and restlessness often stand in the way and until
they are seen and removed, the progress is slow. All those who have
realised on the spot, by mere touch, look or thought, have been ripe for
it. But such are very few. The majority needs some time for
ripening.
<!--l. 4854--><p class="noindent" >Sadhana is accelerated ripening.
<!--l. 4856--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What makes one ripe? What is the ripening factor?
<!--l. 4858--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Earnestness of course, one must be really anxious. After all, the
realised man is the most earnest man. Whatever he does, he does it
completely, without limitations and reservations.

<!--l. 4860--><p class="noindent" >Integrity will take you to reality.
<!--l. 4862--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you love the world?
<!--l. 4864--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you are hurt, you cry. Why? Because you love yourself. Don&#8217;t
bottle up your love by limiting it to the body, keep it open. It will be
then the love for all. When all the false self-identifications are thrown
away, what remains is all-embracing love. Get rid of all ideas about
yourself, even of the idea that you are God. No self-definition is
valid.
<!--l. 4866--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am tired of promises. I am tired of sadhanas, which take all my
time and energy and bring nothing. I want reality here and now. Can I
have it?
<!--l. 4868--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course you can, provided you are really fed up with everything,
including your sadhanas.
<!--l. 4870--><p class="noindent" >When you demand nothing of the world, nor of God, when you want
nothing, seek nothing, expect nothing then the Supreme State will

his sadhana strictly as prescribed by his scriptures, will he get
results?
<!--l. 4874--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Results he will get, but he will be wrapped up in them like in a
cocoon.
<!--l. 4876--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So many saints say that when you are ripe and ready, you will
realise. Their words may be true, but they are of little use. There must
be a way out, independent of ripening which needs time, of sadhana
which needs effort.

<!--l. 4878--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t call it a way; it is more a kind of skill. It is not even that.
Stay open and quiet, that is all.

shape you give yourself obscures your real nature.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should seeking end before one can realise?
<!--l. 4888--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The desire for truth is the highest of all desires, yet, it is still a
desire. All desires must be given up to the real to be. Remember that
you are. This is your working capital. Rotate it and there will be much
profit.
<!--l. 4890--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should there be seeking at all.
<!--l. 4892--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Life is seeking, one cannot help seeking. When all search ceases, it
is the Supreme State.
<!--l. 4894--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why does the Supreme State come and go?
<!--l. 4896--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you speak from your own experience?
<!--l. 4900--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4902--><p class="noindent" ><span

difference?

<!--l. 4904--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe because I have no desires. Or you do not desire the Supreme
strongly enough. You must feel desperate when your mind is out of
touch.
<!--l. 4906--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All my life I was striving and achieved so little. I was reading, I was

<!--l. 4912--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What you gave up is of no importance now. What have you not
given up?. Find that out and give up that. Sadhana is a search for what
to give up. Empty yourself completely.
<!--l. 4914--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can a fool desire wisdom? One needs to know the object of
desire, to desire it. When the Supreme is not known, how can it be

<!--l. 4920--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Self-remembrance, awareness of &#8216;l am&#8217; ripens him powerfully and

thing thoroughly. That is all.
<!--l. 4926--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I was younger, I had strange experiences, short but

memorable, of being nothing, just nothing, yet fully conscious. But the
danger is that one has the desire to recreate from memory the moments
that have passed.
<!--l. 4928--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This is all imagination. In the light of consciousness all sorts of
things happen and one need not give special importance to any. The
sight of a flower is as marvellous as the vision of God. Let them be.
Why remember them and then make memory into a problem? Be bland
about them; do not divide them into high and low, inner and outer,
lasting and transient. Go beyond, go back to the source, go to the self
that is the same whatever happens. Your weakness is due to
your conviction that you were born into the world. In reality
the world is ever recreated in you and by you. See everything
as emanating from the light which is the source of your own
being. You will find that in that light there is love and infinite
energy.
<!--l. 4930--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I am that light, why do I not know it?
<!--l. 4932--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To know, you need a knowing mind, a mind capable of knowing.
But your mind is ever on the run, never still, never fully reflecting. How
can you see the moon in all her glory when the eye is clouded with
disease?
<!--l. 4934--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can we say that while the sun is the cause of the shadow one
cannot see the sun in the shadow. One must turn round.
<!--l. 4936--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again you have introduced the trinity of the sun, the body and
shadow. There is no such division in reality. What I am talking about
has nothing to do with dualities and trinities. Don&#8217;t mentalise and
verbalise. Just see and be.
<!--l. 4938--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 4940--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>See what you are. Don&#8217;t ask others, don&#8217;t let others tell you about
yourself. Look within and see.

and now&#8217; the &#8216;I am&#8217; remains, unassailable. The word exists in
memory, memory comes into consciousness; consciousness exists in
awareness and awareness is the reflection of the light on the waters of
existence.

<!--l. 4960--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still I do not see how can the world be in me when the opposite &#8216;I
am in the world&#8217; is so obvious.
<!--l. 4962--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Even to say &#8216;I am the world, the world is me&#8217;, is a sign of
ignorance. But when I keep in mind and confirm in life my identity
with the world, a power arises in me which destroys the ignorance,
burns it up completely.
<!--l. 4964--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is the witness of ignorance separate from ignorance? Is not to say: &#8216;I
am ignorant&#8217; a part of ignorance?
<!--l. 4966--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. All I can say truly is: &#8216;I am&#8217;, all else is inference. But the
inference has become a habit. Destroy all habits of thinking and seeing.
The sense &#8216;I am&#8217; is the manifestation of a deeper cause, which
you may call self, God, reality or by any other name. The &#8216;I
am&#8217; is in the world; but it is the key which can open the door
out of the world. The moon dancing on the water is seen in the
water, but it is caused by the moon in the sky and not by the
water.
<!--l. 4968--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Still the main point seems to escape me. l can admit that the world
in which I live and move and have my being is of my own creation, a
projection of myself, of my imagination, on the unknown world, the
world as it is, the world of &#8216;absolute matter&#8217;, whatever this matter may
be. The world of my own creation may be quite unlike the ultimate, the
real world, just like the cinema screen is quite unlike the pictures
projected onto it. Nevertheless, this absolute world exists, quite
independent of myself.
<!--l. 4970--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite so, the world of Absolute Reality, onto which your mind has
projected a world of relative unreality is independent of yourself, for
the very simple reason that it is yourself.
<!--l. 4972--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no contradiction in terms? How can independence prove

identity?
<!--l. 4974--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Examine the motion of change and you will see. What can change
while you do not change, can be said to be independent of you. But
what is changeless must be one with whatever else is changeless. For,
duality implies interaction and interaction meats change. In other
words, the absolutely material and the absolutely spiritual, the totally
objective and the totally subjective are identical, both in substance and
essence.
<!--l. 4976--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Like in a tri-dimensional picture, the light forms its own
screen.
<!--l. 4978--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Any comparison will do. The main point to grasp is that you have
projected onto yourself a world of your own imagination, based on
memories, on desires and fears, and that you have imprisoned yourself
in it. Break the spell and be free.
<!--l. 4980--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one break the spell?
<!--l. 4982--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Assert your independence in thought and action. After all, all
hangs on your faith in yourself, on the conviction that what you see
and hear, think and feel is real. Why not question your faith? No
doubt, this world is painted by you on the screen of consciousness and
is entirely your own private world. Only your sense &#8216;I am&#8217;, though in
the world, is not of the world. By no effort of logic or imagination can
you change the &#8216;I am&#8217; into &#8216;I am not&#8217;. In the very denial of your being
you assert it.
<!--l. 4984--><p class="noindent" >Once you realise that the world is your own projection, you are free of
it. You need not free yourself of a world that does not exist, except in
your own imagination! However is the picture, beautiful or ugly, you
are painting it and you are not bound by it. realise that there is
nobody to force it on you, that it is due to the habit of taking the

imaginary to be real. See the Imaginary as imaginary and be free of
fear.
<!--l. 4986--><p class="noindent" >Just as the colours in this carpet are brought out by light but light is
not the colour, so is the world caused by you but you are not the
world.
<!--l. 4988--><p class="noindent" >That which creates and sustains the world, you may call it God or
providence, but ultimately you are the proof that God exists, not the
other way round. For, before any question about God can be put, you
must be there to put it.
<!--l. 4990--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>God is an experience in time, but the experiencer is timeless.
<!--l. 4992--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Even the experiencer is secondary. Primary is the infinite expanse
of consciousness, the eternal possibility, the immeasurable potential of
all that was, is, and will be. When you look at anything, it is the
ultimate you see, but you imagine that you see a cloud or a
tree.
<!--l. 4994--><p class="noindent" >Learn to look without imagination, to listen without distortion: that is
all. Stop attributing names and shapes to the essentially nameless and
formless, realise that every mode of perception is subjective, that what
is seen or heard, touched or smelt, felt or thought, expected or
imagined, is in the mind and not in reality, and you will experience
peace and freedom from fear.
<!--l. 4996--><p class="noindent" >Even the sense of &#8216;I am&#8217; is composed of the pure light and the sense of
being. The &#8216;I&#8217; is there even without the &#8216;am&#8217;. So is the pure
light there whether you say &#8216;I&#8217; or not. Become aware of that
pure light and you will never lose it. The beingness in being, the
awareness in consciousness, the interest in every experience &#8211; that is
not describable, yet perfectly accessible, for there is nothing
else.

<!--l. 4998--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You talk of reality directly &#8211; as the all-pervading, ever-present,
eternal, all-knowing, all-energizing first cause. There are other
teachers, who refuse to discuss reality at all. They say reality is
beyond the mind while all discussions are within the realm of
the mind, which is the home of the unreal. Their approach is
negative; they pinpoint the unreal and thus go beyond it into the
real.
<!--l. 5000--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The difference lies in the words only. After all, when l talk of the
real, I describe it as not-unreal, space-less, time-less, cause-less,
beginning-less and end-less. It comes to the same. As long as it leads to
enlightenment, what does the wording matter? Does it matter whether
you pull the cart or push it, as long as it is kept rolling? You may feel
attracted to reality at one time and repelled from the false at another;
these are only moods which alternate; both are needed for perfect
freedom.
<!--l. 5002--><p class="noindent" >You may go one way or another &#8211; but each time it will be the right way
at the moment; just go whole-heartedly, don&#8217;t waste time on
doubting or hesitating. Many kinds of food are needed to make the
child grow, but the act of eating is the same. Theoretically &#8211; all
approaches are good. In practice, and at a given moment, you proceed
by one road only. Sooner or later you are bound to discover
that if you really want to find, you must dig at one place only &#8211;
within.
<!--l. 5004--><p class="noindent" >Neither your body nor mind can give you what you seek &#8211; the
being and knowing your self and the great peace that comes with
it.
<!--l. 5006--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely there is something valid and valuable in every approach.
<!--l. 5008--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In each case the value lies in bringing you to the need of seeking
within. Playing with various approaches may be due to resistance to

going within, to the fear of having to abandon the illusion of being
something or somebody in particular. To find water you do not dig
small pits all over the place, but drill deep in one place only. Similarly,
to find your self you have to explore yourself. When you realise
that you are the light of the world, you will also realise that
you are the love of it; that to know is to love and to love is to
know.
<!--l. 5010--><p class="noindent" >Of all the affections the love of oneself comes first. Your love of the
world is the reflection of your love of yourself, for your world is of your
own creation. Light and love are impersonal, but they are reflected in
your mind as knowing and wishing oneself well. We are always friendly
towards ourselves. but not always wise. A Yogi is a man whose goodwill
is allied to wisdom.

don&#8217;t need to ask for help.
<!--l. 5022--><p class="noindent" >Indifferent to results, you are willing to work with the most inadequate
means. You do not care to be much gifted and well equipped. Nor do
you ask for recognition and assistance. You just do what needs be done,
leaving success and failure to the unknown. For everything is caused
by innumerable factors, of which your personal endeavour is
but one. Yet such is the magic of man&#8217;s mind and heart that
the most improbable happens when human will and love pull

<!--l. 5026--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Where is the need of asking? It merely shows weakness and anxiety.
Work on, and the universe will work with you. After all the very idea of
doing the right thing comes to you from the unknown. Leave it to the
unknown as far as the results go, just go through the necessary
movements. You are merely one of the links in the long chain of
causation. Fundamentally, all happens in the mind only. When you
work for something whole-heartedly and steadily, it happens, for it is
the function of the mind to make things happen. In reality nothing is
lacking and nothing is needed, all work is on the surface only. In the
depths there is perfect peace. All your problems arise because you have
defined and therefore limited yourself. When you do not think

yourself to be this or that, all conflict ceases. Any attempt to do
something about your problems is bound to fail, for what is caused by
desire can be undone only in freedom from desire. You have
enclosed yourself in time and space, squeezed yourself into the span
of a lifetime and the volume of a body and thus created the
innumerable conflicts of life and death, pleasure and pain, hope
and fear. You cannot be rid of problems without abandoning
illusions.
<!--l. 5028--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5030--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no such thing as a person. There are only restrictions and
limitations. The sum total of these defines the person. You think you
know yourself when you know what you are. But you never know
who you are. The person merely appears to be, like the space
within the pot appears to have the shape and volume and smell
of the pot. See that you are not what you believe yourself to

<!--l. 5032--><p class="noindent" >Fight with all the strength at your disposal against the idea that you

<!--l. 5034--><p class="noindent" >You are not. Refuse to think of yourself in terms of this or that. There
is no other way out of misery, which you have created for yourself
through blind acceptance without investigation. Suffering is a call
for enquiry, all pain needs investigation. Don&#8217;t be too lazy to
think.
<!--l. 5036--><p class="noindent" ><span

Along with thinking something must be done.
<!--l. 5038--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5042--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What do you know about yourself? You can only be what you are
in reality; you can only appear what you are not. You have never
moved away from perfection. All idea of self-improvement is
conventional and verbal. As the sun knows not darkness, so does the
self know not the non-self. It is the mind, which by knowing the other,
becomes the other. Yet the mind is nothing else but the self. It is the
self that becomes the other, the not-self, and yet remains the self. All
else is an assumption. Just as a cloud obscures the sun without in any
way affecting it, so does assumption obscure reality without
destroying it. The very idea of destruction of reality is ridiculous; the
destroyer is always more real than the destroyed. Reality is the
ultimate destroyer. All separation, every kind of estrangement and
alienation is false. All is one &#8211; this is the ultimate solution of every
conflict.

<!--l. 5046--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as we imagine ourselves to be separate personalities, one
quite apart from another, we cannot grasp reality which is essentially
impersonal. First we must know ourselves as witnesses only,
dimensionless and timeless centres of observation, and then realise that
immense ocean of pure awareness, which is both mind and matter and
beyond both.

separate person, one amongst many.
<!--l. 5050--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your being a person is due to the illusion of space and time; you
imagine yourself to be at a certain point occupying a certain volume;
your personality is due to your self-identification with the body. Your
thoughts and feelings exist in succession, they have their span in

time and make you imagine yourself, because of memory, as
having duration. In reality time and space exist in you; you do not
exist in them. They are modes of perception, but they are not
the only ones. Time and space are like words written on paper;
the paper is real, the words merely a convention. How old are
you?

Verbal habits born from assumptions. The mind creates time
and space and takes its own creations for reality. All is here
and now, but we do not see it. Truly, all is in me and by me.
There is nothing else. The very idea of &#8216;else&#8217; is a disaster and a
calamity.

<!--l. 5065--><p class="noindent" ><span

the present with the past and projecting it into the future. Think of

dissolves.

need to remember in order to be. As a matter of fact, before you can
experience anything, there must be the sense of being. At present
your being is mixed up with experiencing. All you need is to
unravel being from the tangle of experiences. Once you have
known pure being, without being this or that, you will discern it
among experiences and you will no longer be misled by names and

you are already. Only cease imagining yourself to be the particular.
What comes and goes has no being. It owes its very appearance to
reality. You know that there is a world, but does the world know you?
All knowledge flows from you, as all being and all joy. realise that you

world is full of contradictions, hence your search for harmony and
peace. These you cannot find in the world, for the world is the child of
chaos. To find order you must search within. The world comes into
being only when you are born in a body. No body &#8211; no world. First
enquire whether you are the body. The understanding of the world will
come later.

who know can improve the bread. Similarly, only those who know the
self, who have seen beyond the world, can improve the world.
Their value to private persons is immense, for they are their
only hope of salvation. What is in the world cannot save the

it.

place to the world, you are bound by it; once you realise, beyond all
trace of doubt that the world is in you and not you in the world, you
are out of it. Of course your body remains in the world and of the
world, but you are not deluded by it. All scriptures say that before the

world was, the Creator was. Who knows the Creator? He alone who
was before the Creator, your own real being, the source of all the
worlds with their creators.
<!--l. 5099--><p class="noindent" ><span

your own projection. You admit that you mean your personal,
subjective world, the world given you through your senses and your

projection. These private worlds hardly touch each other and
they arise from and merge into the &#8216;I am&#8217; at their centre. But
surely behind these private worlds there must be a common
objective world, of which the private worlds are mere shadows. Do
you deny the existence of such an objective world, common to
all?
<!--l. 5101--><p class="noindent" ><span

separate centre. But reality is all and nothing, the totality and the

paradoxical. You cannot speak about it, you can only lose your self in
it. When you deny reality to anything, you come to a residue which
cannot be denied .
<!--l. 5105--><p class="noindent" >All talk of jnana is a sign of ignorance. It is the mind that imagines
that it does not know and then comes to know. Reality knows nothing
of these contortions. Even the idea of God as the Creator is
false. Do I owe my being to any other being? Because I am, all
is.
<!--l. 5107--><p class="noindent" ><span

world, or did your world appear to you? To be born means to create a
world round yourself as the centre. But do you ever create yourself? Or
did anyone create you? Everyone creates a world for himself and lives
in it, imprisoned by one&#8217;s ignorance. All we have to do is to deny
reality to our prison.

food is stopped, the body dies and the mind dissolves. But does the
observer perish?

any other proof. You are yourself, you know yourself, you love
yourself. Whatever the mind does, it does for the love of its own
self.
<!--l. 5147--><p class="noindent" >The very nature of the self is love. It is loved, loving and lovable. It is
the self that makes the body and the mind so interest-ing, so

being independent of mind and body. It is being &#8211; awareness &#8211; bliss.
Awareness of being is bliss.

<!--l. 5155--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To know that you are neither body nor mind, watch yourself
steadily and live unaffected by your body and mind, completely aloof,
as if you were dead. It means you have no vested interests, either in the

<!--l. 5159--><p class="noindent" ><span

only kill the body, you cannot stop the mental process, nor can
you put an end to the person you think you are. Just remain
unaffected.
<!--l. 5161--><p class="noindent" >This complete aloofness, unconcern with mind and body is the best
proof that at the core of your being you are neither mind nor body.
What happens to the body and the mind may not be within
your power to change, but you can always put an end to your
imagining yourself to be body and mind. What-ever happens,
remind yourself that only your body and mind are affected, not
yourself.
<!--l. 5163--><p class="noindent" >The more earnest you are at remembering what needs to be
remembered, the sooner will you be aware of yourself as you are, for
memory will become experience. Earnestness reveals being. What is

the way out.

me and reality. Desire carries me away.
<!--l. 5177--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Increase and widen your desires till nothing but reality can fulfil
them. It is not desire that is wrong, but its narrowness and smallness.
Desire is devotion. By all means be devoted to the real, the infinite,
the eternal heart of being. Transform desire into love. All you
want is to be happy. All your desires, whatever they may be, are
expressions of your longing for happiness. Basically, you wish yourself
well.

<!--l. 5185--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But the self is there. Your desires are there. Your longing
to be happy is there. Why? Because you love yourself. By all
means love yourself &#8211; wisely. What is wrong is to love yourself
stupidly, so as to make yourself suffer. Love yourself wisely. Both
indulgence and austerity have the same purpose in view &#8211; to make
you happy. Indulgence is the stupid way, austerity is the wise

way.

<!--l. 5189--><p class="noindent" ><span

again is austerity. To eschew the unnecessary is austerity. Not to
anticipate pleasure or pain Is austerity. Having things under control at
all times is austerity. Desire by itself is not wrong. It is life itself, the
urge to grow in knowledge and experience.
<!--l. 5191--><p class="noindent" >It is the choices you make that are wrong. To imagine that some little
thing &#8211; food. sex, power, fame

vast and deep as your real self can make you truly and lastingly
happy.

love of self, how should desire be managed?
<!--l. 5197--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Live your life intelligently, with the interests of your deepest self
always in mind. After all, what do you really want? Not perfection; you
are already perfect. What you seek is to express in action what you are.
For this you have a body and a mind. Take them in hand and make
them serve you.

<!--l. 5201--><p class="noindent" ><span

of the instruments, inner and outer, and makes them serve their
purpose.

<!--l. 5205--><p class="noindent" ><span

wherever you are and you create your own climate. Locomotion and
transportation will not give you salvation. You are not the body and
dragging the body from place to place will take you nowhere.
Your mind is free to roam the three worlds &#8211; make full use of
it.

<!--l. 5213--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>you are not in the body, the body is in you! The mind is in you.
They happen to you. They are there because you find them interesting.
Your very nature has the infinite capacity to enjoy. It is full
of zest and affection. It sheds its radiance on all that comes
within its focus of awareness and nothing is excluded. It does not
know evil nor ugliness, it hopes, it trusts, it loves. You people do
not know how much you miss by not knowing your own true
self. You are neither the body nor the mind, neither the fuel
nor the fire. They appear and disappear according to their own
laws.
<!--l. 5215--><p class="noindent" >That which you are, your true self, you love it, and whatever you do,
you do for your own happiness.
<!--l. 5217--><p class="noindent" >To find it, to know it, to cherish it is your basic urge. Since time
immemorial you loved yourself, but never wisely. Use your body and
mind wisely in the service of the self, that is all. Be true to your own
self, love your self absolutely. Do not pretend that you love others as

yourself. Unless you have realised them as one with yourself, you
cannot love them Don&#8217;t pretend to be what you are not, don&#8217;t refuse to
be what you are. Your love of others is the result of self-knowledge, not
its cause.
<!--l. 5219--><p class="noindent" >Without self-realisation, no virtue is genuine. When you know beyond
all doubting that the same life flows through all that is and you are
that life, you will love all naturally and spontaneously. When you
realise the depth and fullness of your love of yourself, you know that
every living being and the entire universe are included in your affection.
But when you look at anything as separate from you, you cannot love it
for you are afraid of it. Alienation causes fear and fear deepens
alienation. It is a vicious circle. Only self-realisation can break it. Go
for it resolutely.

<!--l. 5222--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>In one&#8217;s search for the essential, one soon realises one&#8217;s
inadequacy and the need for a guide or a teacher. This implies a certain
discipline for you are expected to trust your guide and follow implicitly
his advice and instruction. Yet the social urgencies and pressures are so
great, personal desires and fears so powerful, that the simplicity of
mind and will, essential in obedience, are not forthcoming. How to
strike a balance between the need for a Guru and the difficulty in
obeying him implicitly?
<!--l. 5224--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>What is done under pressure of society and circumstances
does not matter much, for it is mostly mechanical, mere reacting to
impacts. It is enough to watch oneself dispassionately to isolate oneself
completely from what is going on. What has been done without
minding, blindly, may add to one&#8217;s karma (destiny), otherwise it hardly
matters. The Guru demands one thing only; clarity and intensity of
purpose, a sense of responsibility for oneself. The very reality of the
world must be questioned. Who is the Guru, after all? He who knows
the state in which there is neither the world nor the thought of
it, he is the Supreme Teacher. To find him means to reach the
state in which imagination is no longer taken for reality. Please,
understand that the Guru stands for reality, for truth, for what is.
He is a realist in the highest sense of the term. He cannot and
shall not come to terms with the mind and its delusions. He
comes to take you to the real; don&#8217;t expect him to do anything
else.
<!--l. 5226--><p class="noindent" >The Guru you have in mind, one who gives you information and
instructions, is not the real Guru.
<!--l. 5228--><p class="noindent" >The real Guru is he who knows the real, beyond the glamour of
appearances. To him your questions about obedience and discipline do
not make sense, for in his eyes the person you take yourself to be does

not exist, your questions are about a non-existing person. What exists
for you does not exist for him. What you take for granted, he denies
absolutely. He wants you to see yourself as he sees you. Then you will
not need a Guru to obey and follow, for you will obey and follow your
own reality. realise that whatever you think yourself to be is just a
stream of events; that while all happens, comes and goes, you alone are,
the changeless among the changeful, the self-evident among the
inferred. Separate the observed from the observer and abandon false
identifications.
<!--l. 5230--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In order to find the reality, one should discard all that stands in the
way. On the other hand, the need to survive within a given society
compels one to do and endure many things. Does one need to
abandon one&#8217;s profession and one&#8217;s social standing in order to find
reality?
<!--l. 5232--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Do your work. When you have a moment free, look within. What
is important is not to miss the opportunity when it presents
itself. If you are earnest you will use your leisure fully. That is
enough.
<!--l. 5234--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In my search for the essential and discarding the unessential, is
there any scope for creative living? For instance, I love painting. Will it
help me if I give my leisure hours to painting?
<!--l. 5236--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whatever you may have to do, watch your mind. Also you must
have moments of complete inner peace and quiet, when your mind
is absolutely still. If you miss it, you miss the entire thing. If
you do not, the silence of the mind will dissolve and absorb all
else.
<!--l. 5238--><p class="noindent" >Your difficulty lies in your wanting reality and being afraid of it at the
same time. You are afraid of it because you do not know it. The
familiar things are known, you feel secure with them. The unknown is

uncertain and therefore dangerous. But to know reality is to
be in harmony with it. And in harmony there is no place for
fear.
<!--l. 5240--><p class="noindent" >An infant knows its body, but not the body-based distinctions. It is
just conscious and happy. After all, that was the purpose for which it
was born. The pleasure to be is the simplest form of self-love, which
later grows into love of the self. Be like an infant with nothing
standing between the body and the self. The constant noise of
the psychic life is absent. In deep silence the self contemplates
the body. It is like the white paper on which nothing is written
yet. Be like that infant, instead of trying to be this or that, be
happy to be. You will be a fully awakened witness of the field of
consciousness.
<!--l. 5242--><p class="noindent" >But there should be no feelings and ideas to stand between you and the
field.
<!--l. 5244--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To be content with mere being seems to be a most selfish way of
passing time.
<!--l. 5246--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A most worthy way of being selfish! By all means be selfish by
foregoing everything but the Self.
<!--l. 5248--><p class="noindent" >When you love the Self and nothing else, you go beyond the selfish and
the unselfish. All distinctions lose their meaning. Love of one and
love of all merge together in love, pure and simple, addressed to
none, denied to none. Stay in that love, go deeper and deeper
into it, investigate yourself and love the investigation and you
will solve not only your own problems but also the problems of
humanity. You will know what to do. Do not ask superficial
questions; apply yourself to fundamentals, to the very roots of your
being.

<!--l. 5250--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there a way for me to speed up my self-realisation?
<!--l. 5252--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course there is.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who will do this speeding up? Will you do it for me?
<!--l. 5256--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither you will do it, nor me. It will just happen.
<!--l. 5258--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My very coming here has proved it. Is this speeding up due to
holy company? When I left last time, I hoped to come back.
And I did! Now I am desperate that so soon I have to leave for
England.
<!--l. 5260--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are like a newly born child. It was there before but not
conscious of its being. At its birth a world arose in it, and with it the
consciousness of being. Now you have just to grow in consciousness,
that is all. The child is the king of the world &#8211; when it grows up, it
takes charge of its kingdom. Imagine that in its infancy it fell seriously
ill and the physician cured it. Does it mean that the young king owes
his kingdom to the physician? Only, perhaps as one of the contributing
factors.
<!--l. 5262--><p class="noindent" >There were so many others; all contributed. But the main factor, the
most crucial, was the fact of being born the son of a king. Similarly,
the Guru may help. But the main thing that helps is to have
reality within. It will assert itself. Your coming here definitely
helped you. It is not the only thing that is going to help you. The
main thing is your own being. Your very earnestness testifies to
it.
<!--l. 5264--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does my pursuing a vocation deny my earnestness?
<!--l. 5266--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I told you already. As long as you allow yourself an abundance of
moments of peace, you can safely practice your most honourable

profession. These moments of inner quiet will burn out all obstacles
without fail. Don&#8217;t doubt its efficacy. Try it.
<!--l. 5268--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But, I did try!
<!--l. 5270--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Never faithfully, never steadily. Otherwise you would not be asking
such questions. You are asking because you are not sure of yourself.
And you are not sure of yourself because you never paid attention to
yourself, only to your experiences. Be interested in yourself beyond all
experience, be with yourself, love yourself; the ultimate security is
found only in self-knowledge. The main thing is earnestness. Be honest
with yourself and nothing will betray you. Virtues and powers are mere
tokens for children to play with. They are useful in the world, but do
not take you out of it. To go beyond, you need alert immobility, quiet
attention.
<!--l. 5272--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What then becomes of one&#8217;s physical being?
<!--l. 5274--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you are healthy, you live on.
<!--l. 5276--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This life of inner immobility, will it not affect one&#8217;s health?
<!--l. 5278--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your body is food transformed. As your food, gross and subtle, so
will be your health.
<!--l. 5280--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what happens to the sex instinct? How can it be controlled?
<!--l. 5282--><p class="noindent" ><span

the body, you will remain in the clutches of food and sex, fear and
death. Find yourself and be free.

<!--l. 5290--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5294--><p class="noindent" ><span

murmuring to myself &#8216;Who am l?&#8217; &#8216;I am, but who am l?&#8217; Or, I did it
mentally. Occasionally I would have some nice feeling, or get into
moods of quiet happiness. On the whole I was trying to be quiet and
receptive, rather than labouring for experiences.

<!--l. 5302--><p class="noindent" ><span

quiet, inwardly and outwardly.
<!--l. 5304--><p class="noindent" ><span

conscious all the same. A sort of wakeful sleep?

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes. Alertly asleep. ( jagrit-sushupti).
<!--l. 5308--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The main thing is to be free of negative emotions &#8211; desire, fear etc.,
the &#8216;six enemies&#8217; of the mind. Once the mind is free of them,

the rest will come easily. Just as cloth kept in soap water will
become clean, so will the mind get purified in the stream of pure

<!--l. 5310--><p class="noindent" >When you sit quiet and watch yourself, all kinds of things may come to
the surface. Do nothing about them, don&#8217;t react to them; as they have

total awareness of oneself or rather, of one&#8217;s mind.
<!--l. 5312--><p class="noindent" ><span

you are the ultimate observer by direct insight, not by a logical process
based on observation. You are what you are, but you know what
you are not. The self is known as being, the not-self is known
as transient. But in reality all is in the mind. The observed,
observation and observer are mental constructs. The self alone
is.
<!--l. 5322--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5324--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To divide and particularise is in the mind&#8217;s very nature. There is no
harm in dividing. But separation goes against fact. Things and people

There are opposites, but no opposition.
<!--l. 5326--><p class="noindent" ><span

against longing for work?
<!--l. 5328--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is a difference between work and mere activity. All nature
works. Work is nature, nature is work. On the other hand, activity is

yourself that you are in bondage, that whatever happens to you is
due to the fact of your bodily existence. Desire, fear, trouble,
joy, they cannot appear unless you are there to appear to. Yet,
whatever happens, points to your existence as a perceiving centre.
Disregard the pointers and be aware of what they are pointing

<!--l. 5346--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the purpose in reminding oneself all the time that one is
the watcher?
<!--l. 5348--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind must learn that beyond the moving mind there is the
background of awareness, which does not change. The mind must come
to know the true self and respect it and cease covering it up, like the
moon which obscures the sun during solar eclipse. Just realise that
nothing observable, or experienceable is you, or binds you. Take no
notice of what is not yourself.
<!--l. 5350--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To do what you tell me I must be ceaselessly aware.
<!--l. 5352--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To be aware is to be awake. Unaware means asleep. You are aware
anyhow, you need not try to be. What you need is to be aware of being
aware. Be aware deliberately and consciously, broaden and deepen the
field of awareness. You are always conscious of the mind, but you are
not aware of yourself as being conscious.
<!--l. 5354--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As I can make out, you give distinct meanings to the words &#8216;mind&#8217;,
&#8216;consciousness&#8217;, and &#8216;awareness&#8217;.
<!--l. 5357--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Look at it this way. The mind produces thoughts ceaselessly, even

when you do not look at them. When you know what is going on in
your mind, you call it consciousness. This is your waking state &#8211; your
consciousness shifts from sensation to sensation, from perception to
perception, from idea to idea, in endless succession. Then comes
awareness, the direct insight into the whole of consciousness, the
totality of the mind. The mind is like a river, flowing ceaselessly in the
bed of the body; you identify yourself for a moment with some
particular ripple and call it: &#8216;my thought&#8217;. All you are conscious of is
your mind; awareness is the cognisance of consciousness as a
whole.
<!--l. 5359--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Everybody is conscious, but not everybody is aware.
<!--l. 5361--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t say: &#8216;everybody is conscious&#8217;. Say: &#8216;there is consciousness&#8217;, in
which everything appears and disappears. Our minds are just waves on
the ocean of consciousness. As waves they come and go. As ocean they
are infinite and eternal. Know yourself as the ocean of being, the
womb of all existence. These are all metaphors of course; the
reality is beyond description. You can know it only by being
it.
<!--l. 5363--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is the search for it worth the trouble?
<!--l. 5365--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Without it all is trouble. If you want to live sanely, creatively and
happily and have infinite riches to share, search for what you
are.
<!--l. 5367--><p class="noindent" >While the mind is centred in the body and consciousness is centred in
the mind, awareness is free.
<!--l. 5369--><p class="noindent" >The body has its urges and mind its pains and pleasures. Awareness is
unattached and unshaken.
<!--l. 5371--><p class="noindent" >It is lucid, silent, peaceful, alert and unafraid, without desire and fear.

Meditate on it as your true being and try to be it in your daily life, and
you shall realise it in its fullness.
<!--l. 5373--><p class="noindent" >Mind is interested in what happens, while awareness is interested in the
mind itself. The child is after the toy, but the mother watches the child,
not the toy.
<!--l. 5375--><p class="noindent" >By looking tirelessly, I became quite empty and with that emptiness all
came back to me except the mind. I find I have lost the mind
irretrievably.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As you talk to us just now, are you unconscious?
<!--l. 5379--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am neither conscious nor unconscious, I am beyond the mind and
its various states and conditions. Distinctions are created by the
mind and apply to the mind only. I am pure Consciousness itself,
unbroken awareness of all that is. I am in a more real state than
yours. I am undistracted by the distinctions and separations
which constitute a person. As long as the body lasts, it has its
needs like any other, but my mental process has come to an
end.
<!--l. 5381--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You behave like a person who thinks.
<!--l. 5383--><p class="noindent" ><span

purposeful.
<!--l. 5385--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If your thinking is unconscious, how do you know that it is
right?
<!--l. 5387--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no desire, nor fear to thwart it. What can make it
wrong? Once I know myself and what I stand for, I do not need to
check on myself all the time. When you know that your watch
shows correct time, you do not hesitate each time you consult

it.
<!--l. 5389--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5391--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5393--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But who is it?
<!--l. 5395--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not who, but what. I&#8217;m not a person in your sense of the
word, though I may appear a person to you. I am that infinite
ocean of consciousness in which all happens. I am also beyond all
existence and cognition, pure bliss of being. There is nothing
I feel separate from, hence I am all. No thing is me, so I am
nothing.
<!--l. 5397--><p class="noindent" >The same power that makes the fire burn and the water flow, the seeds
sprout and the trees grow, makes me answer your questions.
There is nothing personal about me, though the language and the
style may appear personal. A person is a set pattern of desires
and thoughts and resulting actions; there is no such pattern in
my case. There is nothing I desire or fear &#8211; how can there be a
pattern?
<!--l. 5399--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, you will die.
<!--l. 5401--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Life will escape, the body will die, but it will not affect me in the
least. Beyond space and time I am, uncaused, uncausing, yet the very
matrix of existence.
<!--l. 5403--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>May I be permitted to ask how did you arrive at your present
condition?
<!--l. 5405--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>My teacher told me to hold on to the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; tenaciously and
not to swerve from it even for a moment. I did my best to follow

his advice and in a comparatively short time I realised within
myself the truth of his teaching. All I did was to remember his
teaching, his face, his words constantly. This brought an end
to the mind; in the stillness of the mind I saw myself as I am
&#8211;
<!--l. 5407--><p class="noindent" >unbound.
<!--l. 5409--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Was your realisation sudden or gradual.
<!--l. 5411--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither. One is what one is timelessly. It is the mind that realises
as and when it get cleared of desires and fears.
<!--l. 5413--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even the desire for realisation?
<!--l. 5415--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The desire to put an end to all desires is a most peculiar desire,
just like the fear of being afraid is a most peculiar fear. One stops you
from grabbing and the other from running. You may use the same
words, but the states are not the same. The man who seeks realisation
is not addicted to desires; he is a seeker who goes against desire, not
with it. A general longing for liberation is only the beginning; to find
the proper means and use them is the next step. The seeker
has only one goal in view: to find his own true being. Of all
desires it is the most ambitious, for nothing and nobody can
satisfy it; the seeker and the sought are one and the search alone
matters.
<!--l. 5417--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The search will come to an end. The seeker will remain.
<!--l. 5419--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No, the seeker will dissolve, the search will remain. The search is
the ultimate and timeless reality.
<!--l. 5421--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Search means lacking, wanting, incompleteness and imperfection.

<!--l. 5423--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No, it means refusal and rejection of the incomplete and the
imperfect. The search for reality is itself the movement of reality. In a
way all search is for the real bliss, or the bliss of the real. But here we
mean by search the search for oneself as the root of being conscious, as
the light beyond the mind. This search will never end, while the
restless craving for all else must end, for real progress to take
place.
<!--l. 5425--><p class="noindent" >One has to understand that the search for reality, or God, or Guru and
the search for the self are the same; when one is found, all are found.
When &#8216;I am&#8217; and &#8216;God is&#8217; become in your mind indistinguishable, then
something will happen and you will know without a trace of doubt that
God is because you are, you are because God is. The two are
one.
<!--l. 5427--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Since all is preordained, is our self-realisation also preordained? Or
are we free there at least?
<!--l. 5429--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Destiny refers only to name and shape. Since you are neither body
nor mind, destiny has no control over you. You are completely free.
The cup is conditioned by its shape, material, use and so on.
But the space within the cup is free. It happens to be in the
cup only when viewed in connection with the cup. Otherwise
it is just space. As long as there is a body, you appear to be
embodied.
<!--l. 5431--><p class="noindent" >Without the body you are not disembodied &#8211; you Just are.
<!--l. 5433--><p class="noindent" >Even destiny is but an idea. Words can be put together in so many
ways! Statements can differ, but do they make any change in the
actual? There are so many theories devised for explaining things

<!--l. 5439--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you are a beginner certain formalised meditations, or
prayers may be good for you.
<!--l. 5441--><p class="noindent" >But for a seeker for reality there is only one meditation &#8211; the rigorous
refusal to harbour thoughts.
<!--l. 5443--><p class="noindent" >To be free from thoughts is itself meditation.
<!--l. 5445--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is it done?
<!--l. 5447--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You begin by letting thoughts flow and watching them. The very
observation slows down the mind till it stops altogether. Once the mind
is quiet, keep it quiet. Don&#8217;t get bored with peace, be in it, go deeper
into it.
<!--l. 5449--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I heard of holding on to one thought in order to keep other thoughts
away. But how to keep all thoughts away? The very idea is also a
thought.
<!--l. 5451--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Experiment anew, don&#8217;t go by past experience. Watch your
thoughts and watch yourself watching the thoughts. The state of
freedom from all thoughts will happen suddenly and by the bliss of it
you shall recognise it.

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am reading newspapers, I know what is going on! But my reaction
is not like yours. You are looking for a cure, while I am concerned with
prevention. As long as there are causes, there must also be results. As
long as people are bent on dividing and separating, as long as they are
selfish and aggressive, such things will happen. If you want peace and
harmony in the world, you must have peace and harmony in your
hearts and minds. Such change cannot be imposed; it must come
from within. Those who abhor war must get war out of their
system. Without peaceful people how can you have peace in the
world? As long as people are as they are, the world must be
as it is. I am doing my part in trying to help people to know
themselves as the only cause of their own misery. In that sense I
am a useful man. But what I am in myself, what is my normal
state cannot be expressed in terms of social consciousness and
usefulness.
<!--l. 5461--><p class="noindent" >I may talk about it, use metaphors or parables, but I am acutely aware
that it is just not so. Not that it cannot be experienced. It is
experiencing itself! But it cannot be described in the terms of a mind

<!--l. 5463--><p class="noindent" >The world is like a sheet of paper on which something is typed. The
reading and the meaning will vary with the reader, but the paper
is the common factor, always present, rarely perceived. When

left.

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No motive. You say I must have a motive. I am not sitting here,

nor talking: no need to search for motives. Don&#8217;t confuse me with the
body. I have no work to do, no duties to perform. That part of me
which you may call God will look after the world. This world of yours,
that so much needs looking after, lives and moves in your mind. Delve
into it, you will find your answers there and there only. Where else do
you expect them to come from? Outside your consciousness does
anything exist?
<!--l. 5469--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5471--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What kind of existence would it be? Can being be divorced from
knowing? All being, like all knowing, relates to you. A thing is because
you know it to be either in your experience or in your being. Your body
and your mind exist as long as you believe so. Cease to think
that they are yours and they will just dissolve. By all means let
your body and mind function, but do not let them limit you.
If you notice imperfections, just keep on noticing: your very
giving attention to them will set your heart and mind and body
right.

All illness begins in the mind. Take care of the mind first, by tracing
and eliminating all wrong ideas and emotions. Then live and work
disregarding illness and think no more of it. With the removal of causes
the effect is bound to depart.

<!--l. 5490--><p class="noindent" ><span

From a pure source only pure water will flow. I am not concerned with
people&#8217;s desires and fears. I am in tune with facts, not with opinions.
Man takes his name and shape to be himself, while I take nothing to be
myself. Were I to think myself to be a body known by its name, I
would not have been able to answer your questions. Were I to take you
to be a mere body, there would be no benefit to you from my answers.
No true teacher indulges in opinions. He sees things as they
are and shows them as they are. If you take people to be what
they think themselves to be, you will only hurt them, as they
hurt themselves so grievously all the time. But if you see them
as they are in reality, it will do them enormous good. If they
ask you what to do, what practices to adopt, which way of life
to follow, answer: &#8216;Do nothing, just be. In being all happens
naturally.&#8217;
<!--l. 5492--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5494--><p class="noindent" >I feel there is a deep difference in the meaning of the two words.
The natural is orderly, subject to law; one can trust nature; the
accidental is chaotic, unexpected, unpredictable. One could plead
that everything is natural, subject to nature&#8217;s laws; to maintain
that everything is accidental, without any cause, is surely an
exaggeration.

&#8216;accidental&#8217;. In the accidental there is the element of disorder, of
chaos. An accident is always a breach of rules, an exception, a
surprise.
<!--l. 5500--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Is not life itself a stream of surprises?
<!--l. 5502--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is harmony in nature. The accidental is a disturbance.
<!--l. 5504--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You speak as a person, limited in time and space, reduced to the
contents of a body and a mind. What you like, you call &#8216;natural&#8217; and
what you dislike, you call &#8216;accidental&#8217;.
<!--l. 5506--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I like the natural, and the law-abiding, the expected and I fear the
law-breaking, the disorderly, the unexpected, the meaningless. The
accidental is always monstrous. There may be so-called &#8216;lucky
accidents&#8217;, but they only prove the rule that in an accident-prone
universe life would be impossible.
<!--l. 5509--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I feel there is a misunderstanding. By &#8216;accidental&#8217; I mean
something to which no known law applies. When I say everything is
accidental, uncaused, I only mean that the causes and the laws
according to which they operate are beyond our knowing, or even
imagining. If you call what you take to be orderly, harmonious,
predictable, to be natural, then what obeys higher laws and is moved
by higher powers may be called spontaneous. Thus, we shall
have two natural orders: the personal and predictable and the
impersonal, or super-personal, and unpredictable. Call it lower
nature and higher nature and drop the word accidental. As you
grow in knowledge and insight, the borderline between lower
and higher nature keeps on receding, but the two remain until

they are seen as one. For, in fact, everything is most wonderfully
inexplicable!

patterns and laws; it is all right in its own place. But life is to
be lived; there is no time for analysis. The response must be
instantaneous &#8211; hence the importance of the spontaneous, the timeless.

past.

every situation correctly, doing full justice to the need of the
moment, while others fumble, err and generally make a nuisance
of themselves. The harmonised people may be called natural,
ruled by law, while the disintegrated are chaotic and subject to
accidents.
<!--l. 5517--><p class="noindent" ><span

chaos in nature. Only in the mind of man there is chaos. The
mind does not grasp the whole &#8211; its focus is very narrow. It sees
fragments only and fails to perceive the picture. Just as a man who
hears sounds, but does not understand the language, may accuse
the speaker of meaningless jabbering, and be altogether wrong.
What to one is a chaotic stream of sounds is a beautiful poem to
another.
<!--l. 5553--><p class="noindent" >King Janaka once dreamt that he was a beggar. On waking up he asked
his Guru &#8211; Vasishta: Am I a king dreaming of being a beggar, or a
beggar dreaming of being a king? The Guru answered: You are
neither, you are both. You are, and yet you are not what you
think yourself to be. You are because you behave accordingly;
you are not because it does not last. Can you be a king or a
beggar for ever? All must change. You are what does not change.
What are you? Janaka said: Yes, I am neither king nor beggar, I
am the dispassionate witness. The Guru said. This is your last
illusion that you are a jnani, that you are different from, and
superior to, the common man. Again you identify yourself with your

mind, in this case a well-behaved and in every way an exemplary
mind. As long as you see the least difference, you are a stranger
to reality. You are on the level of the mind. When the &#8216;I am
myself&#8217; goes, the &#8216;I am all&#8217; comes. When the &#8216;I am all&#8217; goes, &#8216;I am&#8217;
comes.
<!--l. 5555--><p class="noindent" >When even &#8216;I am&#8217; goes, reality alone is and in it every &#8216;I am&#8217; is
preserved and glorified. Diversity without separateness is the Ultimate
that the mind can touch. Beyond that all activity ceases, because in it
all goals are reached and all purposes fulfilled.
<!--l. 5557--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Once the Supreme State is reached, can it be shared with
others?
<!--l. 5559--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The Supreme State is universal, here and now; everybody already
shares in it. It is the state of being &#8211; knowing and liking. Who does not
like to be, or does not know his own existence? But we take no
advantage of this joy of being conscious, we do not go into it and purify
it of all that is foreign to it. This work of mental self-purification, the
cleansing of the psyche, is essential. Just as a speck in the eye, by
causing inflammation, may wipe out the world, so the mistaken idea: &#8216;I
am the body-mind&#8217; causes the self-concern, which obscures the
universe. It is useless to fight the sense of being a limited and
separate person unless the roots of it are laid bare. Selfishness is
rooted in the mistaken ideas of oneself. Clarification of the mind is
Yoga.

 id="x1-5500050"></a>Self-awareness is the Witness</h2>
<!--l. 5563--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>You told me that I can be considered under three
aspects: the personal ( vyakti), the super-personal ( vyakta) and the
impersonal ( avyakta). The Avyakta is the universal and real pure &#8216;I&#8217;;
the Vyakta is its reflection in consciousness as &#8216;I am&#8217;; the Vyakti is the
totality of physical and vital processes. Within the narrow confines of
the present moment, the super-personal is aware of the person, both
in space and time; not only one person, but the long series of
persons strung together on the thread of karma. It is essentially the
witness as well as the residue of the accumulated experiences, the
seat of memory, the connecting link ( sutratma). It is man&#8217;s
character which life builds and shapes from birth to birth. The
universal is beyond all name and shape, beyond consciousness and
character, pure un-selfconscious being. Did I put down your views
rightly?
<!--l. 5565--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>On the level of the mind &#8211; yes. Beyond the mental level not
a word applies.
<!--l. 5567--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can understand that the person is a mental construct, a collective
noun for a set of memories and habits. But, he to whom the person
happens, the witnessing centre, is it mental too?
<!--l. 5569--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The personal needs a base, a body to identify oneself with, just as a
colour needs a surface to appear on. The seeing of the colour is
independent of the colour &#8211; it is the same whatever the colour. One
needs an eye to see a colour. The colours are many, the eye is single.
The personal is like the light in the colour and also in the eye,
yet simple, single, indivisible and unperceivable, except in its
manifestations. Not unknowable, but unperceivable, un-objectival,
inseparable. Neither material nor mental, neither objective nor
subjective, it is the root of matter and the source of consciousness.
Beyond mere living and dying, it is the all-inclusive, all-exclusive Life,

in which birth is death and death is birth.
<!--l. 5571--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The Absolute or Life you talk about, is it real, or a mere theory to
cover up our ignorance?
<!--l. 5573--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Both. To the mind, a theory; in itself &#8211; a reality. It is reality in its
spontaneous and total rejection of the false. Just as light destroys
darkness by its very presence, so does the absolute destroy imagination.
To see that all knowledge is a form of ignorance is itself a movement of
reality. The witness is not a person. The person comes into being when
there is a basis for it, an organism, a body. In it the absolute is
reflected as awareness. Pure awareness becomes self-awareness. When
there is a self, self-awareness is the witness. When there is no self to
witness, there is no witnessing either. It is all very simple; it is the
presence of the person that complicates. See that there is no such thing
as a permanently separate person and all becomes clear. Awareness &#8211;

<!--l. 5579--><p class="noindent" ><span

object changes all the time. In consciousness there is movement;
awareness by itself is motionless and timeless, here and now.

you react to it?

<!--l. 5585--><p class="noindent" ><span

is it to a suffering man to be told that nobody is aware of his
suffering but himself? To relegate everything to illusion is insult
added to injury. The Bengali of East Pakistan is a fact and his
suffering is a fact. Please, do not analyse them out of existence! You
are reading newspapers, you hear people talking about it. You
cannot plead ignorance. Now, what is your attitude to what is
happening?
<!--l. 5587--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No attitude. Nothing is happening.
<!--l. 5589--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Any day there may be a riot right in front of you, perhaps people
killing each other. Surely you cannot say: nothing is happening and
remain aloof.
<!--l. 5591--><p class="noindent" ><span

into the fray to save somebody and getting killed. Yet to me nothing
happened.
<!--l. 5593--><p class="noindent" >Imagine a big building collapsing. Some rooms are in ruins, some are
intact. But can you speak of the space as ruined or intact? It is only
the structure that suffered and the people who happened to live in it.
Nothing happened to space itself. Similarly, nothing happens to life
when forms break down and names are wiped out. The goldsmith melts
down old ornaments to make new. Sometimes a good piece goes with
the bad. He takes it in his stride, for he knows that no gold is
lost.
<!--l. 5595--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is not death that I rebel against. It is the manner of dying.
<!--l. 5597--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Death is natural, the manner of dying is man-made. Separateness
causes fear and aggression, which again cause violence. Do away with
man-made separations and all this horror of people killing each other
will surely end. But in reality there is no killing and no dying. The real

does not die, the unreal never lived. Set your mind right and all will be
right. When you know that the world is one, that humanity is one, you
will act accordingly. But first of all you must attend to the way you
feel, think and live. Unless there is order in yourself, there can be no
order in the world.
<!--l. 5599--><p class="noindent" >In reality nothing happens. Onto the screen of the mind destiny
forever projects its pictures, memories of former projections and
thus illusion constantly renews itself. The pictures come and
go

picture.
<!--l. 5603--><p class="noindent" ><span

getting killed and here you talk of pictures.
<!--l. 5605--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means go and get killed yourself &#8211; if that is what you think
you should do. Or even go and kill, if you take it to be your duty. But
that is not the way to end the evil. Evil is the stench of a mind that is
diseased. Heal your mind and it will cease to project distorted, ugly
pictures.
<!--l. 5607--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What you say I understand, but emotionally I cannot accept it.
This merely idealistic view of life repels me deeply. I just cannot think
myself to be permanently in a state of dream.
<!--l. 5609--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can anybody be permanently in a state caused by an
impermanent body? The misunderstanding is based on your idea that
you are the body. Examine the idea, see its inherent contradictions,
realise that your present existence is like a shower of sparks, each spark
lasting a second and the shower itself &#8211; a minute or two. Surely a thing
of which the beginning is the end, can have no middle. Respect your
terms. Reality cannot be momentary. It is timeless, but timelessness is

not duration.
<!--l. 5611--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I admit that the world in which I live is not the real world. But
there is a real world, of which I see a distorted picture. The distortion
may be due to some blemish in my body or mind. But when you
say there is no real world, only a dream world in my mind, I
just cannot take it. I wish I could believe that all horrors of
existence are due to my having a body. Suicide would be the way
out.
<!--l. 5613--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you pay attention to ideas, your own or of others, you
will be in trouble. But if you disregard all teachings, all books,
anything out into words and dive deeply within yourself and find
yourself, this alone will solve all your problems and leave you in full
mastery of every situation, because you will not be dominated by your
ideas about the situation. Take an example. You are in the company of
an attractive woman. You get ideas about her and this creates a sexual
situation. A problem is created and you start looking for books on
continence, or enjoyment. Were you a baby, both of you could
be naked and together without any problem arising. Just stop
thinking you are the bodies and the problems of love and sex
will lose their meaning. With all sense of limitation gone, fear,
pain and the search for pleasure &#8211; all cease. Only awareness
remains.

a man who is carrying a bomb that is going to explode. He cannot
defuse it, he cannot throw it away. He is terribly frightened and is
searching frantically for a solution, which he cannot find. To me
liberation is getting rid of this bomb. I do not know much about the
bomb. I only know that it comes from early childhood. I feel like the
frightened child protesting passionately against not being loved. The

child is craving for love and because he does not get it, he is afraid and
angry. Sometimes I feel like killing somebody or myself. This desire is
so strong that I am constantly afraid. And I do not know how to get
free from fear.

<!--l. 5643--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It may be the habitual state, but it need not be the normal state. A
normal state cannot be painful, while a habit often leads to chronic
pain.
<!--l. 5645--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If it is not the natural, or normal state of mind, then how to stop
it? There must be a way to quieten the mind. How often I tell
myself: enough, please stop, enough of this endless chatter of
sentences repeated round and round! But my mind would not
stop. I feel that one can stop it for a while, but not for long.
Even the so-called &#8216;spiritual&#8217; people use tricks to keep their mind
quiet. They repeat formulas, they sing, pray, breathe forcibly
or gently, shake, rotate, concentrate, meditate, chase trances,
cultivate virtues &#8211; working all the time, in order to cease working,
cease chasing, cease moving. Were it not so tragic, it would be

ridiculous.
<!--l. 5647--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind exists in two states: as water and as honey. The water
vibrates at the least disturbance, while the honey, however disturbed,
returns quickly to immobility.
<!--l. 5649--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By its very nature the mind is restless. It can perhaps be made
quiet, but it is not quiet by itself.
<!--l. 5651--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You may have a chronic fever and shiver all the time. It is desires
and fears that make the mind restless. Free from all negative emotions
it is quiet.
<!--l. 5653--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You cannot protect the child from negative emotions. As soon as it
is born it learns pain and fear. Hunger is a cruel master and teaches
dependence and hate. The child loves the mother because she feeds it
and hates her because she is late with food. Our unconscious mind is
full of conflicts, which overflow into the conscious. We live on a
volcano; we are always in danger. I agree that the company of
people whose mind is peaceful has a very soothing affect, but as
soon as I am away from them, the old trouble starts. This is
why I come periodically to India to seek the company of my
Guru.
<!--l. 5655--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You think you are coming and going, passing through various states
and moods. I see things as they are, momentary events, presenting
themselves to me in rapid succession, deriving their being from me, yet
definitely neither me nor mine. Among phenomena I am not
one, nor subject to any. I am independent so simply and totally,
that your mind, accustomed to opposition and denial, cannot
grasp it. I mean literally what I say; I do not need oppose, or
deny, because it is clear to me that I cannot be the opposite or
denial of anything. I am just beyond, in a different dimension
altogether.

<!--l. 5657--><p class="noindent" >Do not look for me in identification with, or opposition to something: I
am where desire, and fear are not. Now, what is your experience?
Do you also feel that you stand totally aloof from all transient
things?

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, I do &#8211; occasionally. But at once a sense of danger sets in, I feel
isolated, outside all relationship with others. You see, here lies
the difference in our mentalities. With the Hindu, the emotion
follows the thought. Give a Hindu an idea and his emotions
are roused. With the Westerner it is the opposite: give him an
emotion and he will produce an idea. Your ideas are very attractive

<!--l. 5665--><p class="noindent" ><span

feelings there can be no action.
<!--l. 5667--><p class="noindent" ><span

watching what happens, without being able to influence it in any
way.

that I just can do nothing?
<!--l. 5671--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5675--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Certainly not. It is your illness on one side and the pressure of your
physician and family on the other that have made you decide. You have
no choice, only the illusion of it.

power I lack, but the knowledge.
<!--l. 5679--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not knowing the means is admittedly as bad as not having the
power! But let us drop the subject for the moment; after all it is not
important why we feel helpless, as long as we see clearly that for the
time being we are helpless.
<!--l. 5681--><p class="noindent" >I am now 74 years old. And yet I feel that I am an infant. I feel clearly
that in spite of all the changes I am a child. My Guru told me: that
child, which is you even now, is your real self ( swarupa). Go
back to that state of pure being, where the &#8216;I am&#8217; is still in its
purity before it got contaminated with &#8216;this I am&#8217; or &#8216;that I am&#8217;.
Your burden is of false self-identifications &#8211; abandon them all.
My Guru told me &#8211; &#8216;Trust me. I tell you; you are divine. Take
it as the absolute truth. Your joy is divine, your suffering is
divine too. All comes from God. Remember it always. You are
God, your will alone is done&#8217;. I did believe him and soon realised
how wonderfully true and accurate were his words. I did not
condition my mind by thinking: &#8216;I am God, I am wonderful, I am
beyond&#8217;. I simply followed his instruction which was to focus the
mind on pure being &#8216;I am&#8217;, and stay in it. I used to sit for hours
together, with, nothing but the &#8216;I am&#8217; in my mind and soon
peace and joy and a deep all-embracing love became my normal
state. In it all disappeared &#8211; myself, my Guru, the life I lived,
the world around me. Only peace remained and unfathomable
silence.
<!--l. 5684--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It all looks very simple and easy, but it is just not so. Sometimes

the wonderful state of joyful peace dawns on me and I look and
wonder: how easily it comes and how intimate it seems, how totally my
own. Where was the need to strive so hard for a state so near at hand?
This time, surely, it has come to stay. Yet how soon it all dissolves
and leaves me wondering &#8211; was it a taste of reality or another
aberration. If it was reality, why did it go? Maybe some unique
experience is needed to fix me for good in the new state and until
the crucial experience comes, this game of hide and seek must
continue.
<!--l. 5686--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your expectation of something unique and dramatic, of some
wonderful explosion, is merely hindering and delaying your self-realisation.
You are not to expect an explosion, for the explosion has already
happened &#8211; at the moment when you were born, when you realised
yourself as being-knowing-feeling. There is only one mistake you
are making: you take the inner for the outer and the outer for
the inner. What is in you, you take to be outside you and what
is outside, you take to be in you. The mind and feelings are
external, but you take them to be intimate. You believe the
world to be objective, while it is entirely a projection of your
psyche. That is the basic confusion and no new explosion will set it
right. You have to think yourself out of it. There is no other
way.
<!--l. 5688--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to think myself out when my thoughts come and
go as they like. Their endless chatter distracts and exhausts
me.
<!--l. 5690--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Watch your thoughts as you watch the street traffic. People come
and go; you register without response. It may not be easy in the
beginning, but with some practice you will find that your mind can
function on many levels at the same time and you can be aware of
them all. It is only when you have a vested interest in any particular
level, that your attention gets caught in it and you black out on other

levels. Even then the work on the blacked out levels goes on, outside
the field of consciousness. Do not struggle with your memories
and thoughts; try only to include in your field of attention the
other, more important questions, like &#8216;Who am l?&#8217; &#8216;How did I
happen to be born?&#8217; &#8216;Whence this universe around me?&#8217;. &#8216;What is
real and what is momentary?&#8217; No memory will persist, if you
lose interest in it, it is the emotional link that perpetuates the
bondage. You are always seeking pleasure, avoiding pain, always
after happiness and peace. Don&#8217;t you see that it is your very
search for happiness that makes you feel miserable? Try the
other way: indifferent to pain and pleasure, neither asking, nor
refusing, give all your attention to the level on which &#8216;I am&#8217; is
timelessly present. Soon you will realise that peace and happiness are
in your very nature and it is only seeking them through some
particular channels, that disturbs. Avoid the disturbance, that is all.
To seek there is no need; you would not seek what you already
have. You yourself are God, the Supreme Reality. To begin with,
trust me, trust the Teacher. It enables you to make the first step
&#8211;
<!--l. 5693--><p class="noindent" >and then your trust is justified by your own experience. In every walk
of life initial trust is essential; without it little can be done. Every
undertaking is an act of faith. Even your daily bread you eat on trust!
By remembering what I told you you will achieve everything. I am
telling you again: You are the all-pervading, all transcending
reality. Behave accordingly: think, feel and act in harmony with
the whole and the actual experience of what I say will dawn
upon you in no time. No effort is needed. Have faith and act
on it. Please see that I want nothing from you. It is in your
own interest that l speak, because above all you love yourself,
you want yourself secure and happy. Don&#8217;t be ashamed of it,
don&#8217;t deny it. It is natural and good to love oneself. Only you
should know what exactly do you love. It is not the body that
you love, it is Life &#8211;perceiving, feeling, thinking, doing, loving,

striving, creating. It is that Life you love, which is you, which is all.
realise it in its totality, beyond all divisions and limitations,
and all your desires will merge in it, for the greater contains
the smaller. Therefore find yourself, for in finding that you find
all.
<!--l. 5695--><p class="noindent" >Everybody is glad to be. But few know the fullness of it. You
come to know by dwelling in your mind on &#8216;I am&#8217;, &#8216;I know&#8217;, &#8216;I
love&#8217; &#8211; with the will of reaching the deepest meaning of these
words.
<!--l. 5697--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5699--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t identify yourself with an idea. If you mean by God the
Unknown, then you merely say: &#8216;I do not know what I am&#8217;. If you
know God as you know your self, you need not say it. Best is
the simple feeling &#8216;I am&#8217;. Dwell on it patiently. Here patience is
wisdom; don&#8217;t think of failure. There can be no failure in this
undertaking.

<!--l. 5703--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pay no attention. Don&#8217;t fight them. Just do nothing about them,
let them be, whatever they are.
<!--l. 5705--><p class="noindent" >Your very fighting them gives them life. Just disregard. Look
through. Remember to remember: &#8216;whatever happens &#8211; happens
because I am&#8217;. All reminds you that you are. Take full advantage
of the fact that to experience you must be. You need not stop
thinking. Just cease being interested. It is disinterestedness that
liberates. Don&#8217;t hold on, that is all. The world is made of rings.
The hooks are all yours. Make straight your hooks and nothing
can hold you. Give up your addictions. There is nothing else
to give up. Stop your routine of acquisitiveness, your habit of

looking for results and the freedom of the universe is yours. Be
effortless.

<!--l. 5710--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What needs doing, do it. Don&#8217;t resist. Your balance must be
dynamic, based on doing just the right thing, from moment to moment.
Don&#8217;t be a child unwilling to grow up. Stereotyped gestures and
postures will not help you. Rely entirely on your clarity of thought,
purity of motive and integrity of action. You cannot possibly go wrong .
Go beyond and leave all behind.

<!--l. 5714--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You want something like a round-the-clock ecstasy. Ecstasies come
and go, necessarily, for the human brain cannot stand the tension for a
long time. A prolonged ecstasy will burn out your brain, unless it is
extremely pure and subtle. In nature nothing is at stand-still,
everything pulsates, appears and disappears. Heart, breath, digestion,
sleep and waking &#8211; birth and death everything comes and goes in
waves. Rhythm, periodicity, harmonious alternation of extremes is the
rule. No use rebelling against the very pattern of life. If you seek the
Immutable, go beyond experience.
<!--l. 5716--><p class="noindent" >When I say: remember &#8216;I am&#8217; all the time, I mean: &#8216;come back to it
repeatedly&#8217;. No particular thought can be mind&#8217;s natural state, only
silence. Not the idea of silence, but silence itself. When the mind is in
its natural state, it reverts to silence spontaneously after every
experience or, rather, every experience happens against the background
of silence.
<!--l. 5718--><p class="noindent" >Now, what you have learnt here becomes the seed. You may forget it &#8211;
apparently. But it will live and in due season sprout and grow and
bring forth flowers and fruits. All will happen by itself. You need not do

anything, only don&#8217;t prevent it.

 id="x1-5700052"></a>Being Happy, Making Happy is the Rhythm of Life</h2>
<!--l. 5722--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I came from Europe a few months ago on one of my
periodical visits to my Guru near Calcutta. Now I am on my way back
home. I was invited by a friend to meet you and I am glad I
came.
<!--l. 5724--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>What did you learn from your Guru and what practice did
you follow?
<!--l. 5726--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>He is a venerable old man of about eighty. Philosophically he is a
Vedantin and the practice he teaches has much to do with rousing the
unconscious energies of the mind and bringing the hidden obstacles and
blockages into the conscious. My personal sadhana was related to my
peculiar problem of early infancy and childhood. My mother could
not give me the feeling of being secure and loved, so important
to the child&#8217;s normal development. She was a woman not fit
to be a mother; ridden with anxieties and neuroses, unsure of
herself, she felt me to be a responsibility and a burden beyond her
capacity to bear. She never wanted me to be born. She did not
want me to grow and to develop, she wanted me back in her
womb, unborn, non-existent. Any movement of life in me she
resisted, any attempt to go beyond the narrow circle of her habitual
existence she fought fiercely. As a child I was both sensitive and
affectionate. I craved for love above everything else and love, the
simple, instinctive love of a mother for her child was denied me.
The child&#8217;s search for its mother became the leading motive
of my life and I never grew out of it. A happy child, a happy
childhood became an obsession with me. Pregnancy, birth, infancy
interested me passionately. I became an obstetrician of some renown
and contributed to the development of the method of painless
childbirth. A happy child of a happy mother &#8211; that was my ideal all
my life. But my mother was always there &#8211; unhappy herself,
unwilling and incapable to see me happy. It manifested itself in

strange ways. Whenever I was unwell, she felt better; when I
was in good shape, she was down again, cursing herself and me
too. As if she never forgave me my crime of having been born,
she made me feel guilty of being alive. &#8216;You live because you
hate me. If you love me &#8211; die&#8217;, was her constant, though silent
message. And so I spent my life, being offered death instead of
love.
<!--l. 5728--><p class="noindent" >Imprisoned, as I was, in my mother, the perennial infant, I could not
develop a meaningful relation with a woman; the image of the mother
would stand between, unforgiving, unforgiven. I sought solace in my
work and found much; but I could not move from the pit of
infancy. Finally, I turned to spiritual search and I am on this line
steadily for many years. But, in a way it is the same old search for
mother&#8217;s love, call it God or Atma or Supreme Reality. Basically I
want to love and be loved; unfortunately the so-called religious
people are against life and all for the mind. When faced with
life&#8217;s needs and urges, they begin by classifying, abstracting and
conceptualising and then make the classification more important
than life itself. They ask to concentrate on and impersonate a
concept.
<!--l. 5730--><p class="noindent" >Instead of the spontaneous integration through love they recommend a
deliberate and laborious concentration on a formula. Whether it is God
or Atma, the me or the other, it comes to the same!
<!--l. 5732--><p class="noindent" >Something to think about, not somebody to love. It is not theories and
systems that I need; there are many equally attractive or plausible. I
need a stirring of the heart, a renewal of life, and not a new way of
thinking. There are no new ways of thinking, but feelings can be ever
fresh. When I love somebody, I meditate on him spontaneously and
powerfully, with warmth and vigour, which my mind cannot
command.

<!--l. 5734--><p class="noindent" >Words are good for shaping feelings; words without feeling are like
clothes with no body inside &#8211;
<!--l. 5736--><p class="noindent" >cold and limp. This mother of mine &#8211; she drained me of all feelings
&#8211; my sources have run dry. Can I find here the richness and
abundance of emotions, which I needed in such ample measure as a
child?
<!--l. 5738--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Where is your childhood now? And what is your future?
<!--l. 5740--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I was born, I have grown, I shall die.
<!--l. 5742--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You mean your body, of course. And your mind. I am not talking of
your physiology and psychology. They are a part of nature and are
governed by nature&#8217;s laws. I am talking of your search for love. Had it a
beginning? Will it have an end?
<!--l. 5744--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I really cannot say. It is there &#8211; from the earliest to the last
moment of my life. This yearning for love &#8211; how constant and how
hopeless!
<!--l. 5746--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In your search for love what exactly are you searching for?
<!--l. 5748--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Simply this: to love and to be loved.
<!--l. 5750--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You mean a woman?
<!--l. 5752--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Not necessarily. A friend, a teacher, a guide &#8211; as long as the feeling
is bright and clear. Of course, a woman is the usual answer. But it need
not be the only one.
<!--l. 5754--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of the two what would you prefer, to love or to be loved?
<!--l. 5756--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I would rather have both! But I can see that to love is greater,

nobler, deeper. To be loved is sweet, but it does not make one
grow.
<!--l. 5758--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Can you love on your own, or must you be made to love?
<!--l. 5760--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>One must meet somebody lovable, of course. My mother was not
only not loving, she was also not lovable.
<!--l. 5762--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What makes a person lovable? Is it not the being loved? First you
love and then you look for reasons.
<!--l. 5764--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It can be the other way round. You love what makes you
happy.
<!--l. 5766--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But what makes you happy?
<!--l. 5768--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is no rule about it. The entire subject is highly individual and
unpredictable.
<!--l. 5770--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Right. Whichever way you put it, unless you love there is
no happiness. But, does love make you always happy? Is not
the association of love with happiness a rather early, infantile
stage?
<!--l. 5772--><p class="noindent" >When the beloved suffers, don&#8217;t you suffer too? And do you cease to
love, because you suffer?
<!--l. 5774--><p class="noindent" >Must love and happiness come and go together? Is love merely the
expectation of pleasure?
<!--l. 5776--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Of course not. There can be much suffering in love.
<!--l. 5778--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Then what is love? Is it not a state of being rather than a
state of mind? Must you know that you love in order to love?

Did you. not love your mother unknowingly? Your craving for
her love, for an opportunity to love her, is it not the movement
of love? Is not love as much a part of you, as consciousness of
being? You sought the love of your mother, because you loved
her.
<!--l. 5780--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But she would not let me!
<!--l. 5782--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>She could not stop you.
<!--l. 5784--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then, why was I unhappy all my life?
<!--l. 5786--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because you did not go down to the very roots of your being. It
is your complete ignorance of yourself, that covered up your
love and happiness and made you seek for what you had never
lost.
<!--l. 5788--><p class="noindent" >Love is will, the will to share your happiness with all. Being happy &#8211;
making happy &#8211; this is the rhythm of love.

<!--l. 5796--><p class="noindent" ><span

kicks.
<!--l. 5808--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Let it kick. Just look at the kicking. And if you are too afraid of
the society to kick convincingly look at that too. I know it is a painful
business. But there is no remedy &#8211; except one &#8211; the search for remedies
must cease.
<!--l. 5810--><p class="noindent" >If you are angry or in pain, separate yourself from anger and pain and
watch them. Externalisation is the first step to liberation. Step away
and look. The physical events will go on happening, but by themselves

they have no importance. It is the mind alone that matters. Whatever
happens, you cannot kick and scream in an airline office or in a Bank.
Society does not allow it. If you do not like their ways, or are not
prepared to endure them, don&#8217;t fly or carry money. Walk, and
if you cannot walk, don&#8217;t travel. If you deal with society you
must accept its ways, for its ways are your ways. Your needs and
demands have created them. Your desires are so complex and
contradictory &#8211; no wonder the society you create is also complex and
contradictory.
<!--l. 5812--><p class="noindent" ><span

own inner disharmony. But what is the remedy?
<!--l. 5814--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t seek remedies.
<!--l. 5816--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sometimes one is in a &#8216;state of grace&#8217; and life is happy and
harmonious. But such a state does not last! The mood changes and all
goes wrong.
<!--l. 5818--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you could only keep quiet, clear of memories and expectations,
you would be able to discern the beautiful pattern of events. It is your
restlessness that causes chaos.
<!--l. 5820--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>For full three hours that I spent in the airline office I was practising
patience and forbearance. It did not speed up matters.
<!--l. 5822--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>At least it did not slow them down, as your kicking would have
surely done! You want immediate results! We do not dispense magic
here. Everybody does the same mistake: refusing the means, but
wanting the ends. You want peace and harmony in the world, but
refuse to have them in yourself. Follow my advice implicitly and you
will not be disappointed. I cannot solve your problem by mere words.
You have to act on what I told you and persevere. It is not the right
advice that liberates, but the action based on it. Just like a doctor,

after giving the patient an injection, tells him: &#8216;Now, keep quiet. Do
nothing more, just keep quiet,&#8217; I am telling you: you have got your
&#8216;injection&#8217;, now keep quiet, just keep quiet. You have nothing else to
do. My Guru did the same. He would tell me something and then said:
&#8216;Now keep quiet. Don&#8217;t go on ruminating all the time. Stop. Be
silent&#8217;.
<!--l. 5825--><p class="noindent" ><span

many things happen that throw me out of balance. It is easy to say &#8216;be

please tell me how it is done.

for work, the right motive. Must you know everything beforehand?
Don&#8217;t be anxious about your future &#8211; be quiet now and all will fall in
place. The unexpected is bound to happen, while the anticipated may
never come. Don&#8217;t tell me you cannot control your nature. You need
not control it. Throw it overboard. Have no nature to fight, or
to submit to. No experience will hurt you, provided you don&#8217;t
make it into a habit. Of the entire universe you are the subtle
cause. All is because you are. Grasp this point firmly and deeply
and dwell on it repeatedly. To realise this as absolutely true, is
liberation.

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nature is neither pleasant nor painful. It is all intelligence and
beauty. Pain and pleasure are in the mind. Change your scale of values
and all will change. Pleasure and pain are mere disturbances of the
senses; treat them equally and there will be only bliss. And the world
is, what you make it; by all means make it happy. Only contentment
can make you happy &#8211; desires fulfilled breed more desires. Keeping
away from all desires and contentment in what comes by itself is a
very fruitful state &#8211; a precondition to the state of fullness. Don&#8217;t
distrust its apparent sterility and emptiness. Believe me, it is the
satisfaction of desires that breeds misery. Freedom from desires is
bliss.

towards the future &#8211; the future will come to you on its own. For
some time longer you will remain sleep-walking, as you do now,
bereft of meaning and assurance; but this period will end and you
will find your work both fruitful and easy. There are always
moments when one feels empty and estranged. Such moments
are most desirable for it means the soul had cast its moorings

and is sailing for distant places. This is detachment &#8211; when the
old is over and the new has not yet come. If you are afraid, the
state may be distressing; but there is really nothing to be afraid
of. Remember the instruction: whatever you come across &#8211; go
beyond.

I find it so difficult to remember the right thing at the right moment.
With me forgetting seems to be the rule!
<!--l. 5853--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not easy to remember when every situation brings up a storm

desirable or hateful. Remove the rocks by insight and detachment and
the same waters will flow deep and silent and swift, in greater volume
and with greater power. Don&#8217;t be theoretical about it, give time to
thought and consideration; if you desire to be free, neglect not
the nearest step to freedom. It is like climbing a mountain: not
a step can be missed. One step less &#8211; and the summit is not
reached.

the absolute ( vyakti-vyakta-avyakta). As far as I remember, you said
that the absolute alone is real and the witness is absolute only at
a given point of space and time. The person is the organism,
gross and subtle, illumined by the presence of the witness. I
do not seem to grasp the matter clearly; could we discuss it
again?
<!--l. 5863--><p class="noindent" >You also use the terms mahadakash, chidakash and paramakash. How
are they related to person, witness, and the absolute?
<!--l. 5865--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Mahadakash is nature, the ocean of existences, the physical
space with all that can be contacted through the senses. Chidakash is
the expanse of awareness, the mental space of time, perception and
cognition. Paramakash is the timeless and spaceless reality, mindless,
undifferentiated, the infinite potentiality, the source and origin, the
substance and the essence, both matter and consciousness &#8211; yet beyond
both. It cannot be perceived, but can be experienced as ever witnessing
the witness, perceiving the perceiver, the origin and the end of all
manifestation, the root of time and space, the prime cause in every
chain of causation.

<!--l. 5869--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no difference. It is like light and daylight. The universe is
full of light which you do not see; but the same light you see as
daylight. And what the daylight reveals is the vyakti, The person is
always the object, the witness is the subject and their relation of
mutual dependence is the reflection of their absolute identity. You
imagine that they are distinct and separate states. They are not. They
are the same consciousness at rest and in movement, each state
conscious of the other.

<!--l. 5871--><p class="noindent" >In chit man knows God and God knows man. In chit the man shapes
the world and the world shapes man. Chit is the link, the bridge
between extremes, the balancing and uniting factor in every experience.
The totality of the perceived is what you call matter. The totality of
all perceivers is what you call the universal mind. The identity

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The sciences have made much progress. We know the body
and the mind much better than our ancestors. Your traditional
way, describing and analysing mind and matter, is no longer
valid.
<!--l. 5883--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But where are your scientists with their sciences? Are they not
again images in your own mind?
<!--l. 5885--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Here lies the basic difference! To me they are not my own
projections. They were before I was born and shall be there when I am

dead.
<!--l. 5887--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. Once you accept time and space as real, you will
consider yourself minute and short-lived. But are they real? Do they
depend on you, or you on them? As body, you are in space. As mind,
you are in time. But are you mere body with a mind in it? Have you
ever investigated?
<!--l. 5889--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I had neither the motive nor the method.
<!--l. 5891--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am suggesting both. But the actual work of insight and
detachment ( viveka-vairagya) is yours.
<!--l. 5893--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The only motive I can perceive is my own causeless and timeless
happiness. And what is the method?
<!--l. 5895--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Happiness is incidental. The true and effective motive is love. You
see people suffer and you seek the best way of helping them. The
answer is obvious &#8211; first put yourself beyond the need of help. Be
sure your attitude is of pure goodwill, free of expectation of any
kind.
<!--l. 5897--><p class="noindent" >Those who seek mere happiness may end up in sublime indifference,
while love will never rest.
<!--l. 5899--><p class="noindent" >As to method, there is only one &#8211; you must come to know yourself &#8211;
both what you appear to be and what you are. Clarity and charity go
together &#8211; each needs and strengthens the other.
<!--l. 5901--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Compassion implies the existence of an objective world, full of
avoidable sorrow.
<!--l. 5903--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world is not objective and the sorrow of it is not avoidable.
Compassion is but another word for the refusal to suffer for imaginary

reasons.
<!--l. 5905--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If the reasons are imaginary, why should the suffering be
inevitable?
<!--l. 5907--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is always the false that makes you suffer, the false desires and
fears, the false values and ideas, the false relationships between people.
Abandon the false and you are free of pain; truth makes happy &#8211; truth
liberates.
<!--l. 5909--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The truth is that I am a mind imprisoned in a body and this is a
very unhappy truth.
<!--l. 5911--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are neither the body nor in the body &#8211; there is no such thing
as body. You have grievously misunderstood yourself; to understand
rightly &#8211; investigate.
<!--l. 5913--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But I was born as a body, in a body and shall die with the body, as
a body.
<!--l. 5915--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This is your misconception. Enquire, investigate, doubt yourself
and others. To find truth, you must not cling to your convictions; if you
are sure of the immediate, you will never reach the ultimate. Your idea
that you were born and that you will die is absurd: both logic and
experience contradict it.
<!--l. 5917--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All right, I shall not insist that I am the body. You have a point
here. But here and now, as I talk to you, I am in my body &#8211; obviously.
The body may not be me, but it is mine.
<!--l. 5919--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The entire universe contributes incessantly to your existence. Hence
the entire universe is your body. In that sense &#8211; I agree.
<!--l. 5921--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My body influences me deeply. In more than one way my body is

my destiny. My character, my moods, the nature of my reactions, my
desires and fears &#8211; inborn or acquired &#8211; they are all based on the body.
A little alcohol, some drug or other and all changes. Until the drug
wears off I become another man.
<!--l. 5923--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All this happens because you think yourself to be the body.
realise your real self and even drugs will have no power over
you.
<!--l. 5925--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You smoke?
<!--l. 5927--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>My body kept a few habits which may as well continue till it dies.
There is no harm in them.
<!--l. 5929--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You eat meat?
<!--l. 5931--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I was born among meat-eating people and my children are eating
meat. I eat very little &#8211; and make no fuss.
<!--l. 5933--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Meat-eating implies killing.
<!--l. 5935--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Obviously. I make no claims of consistency. You think absolute
consistency is possible; prove it by example. Don&#8217;t preach what you do
not practise.
<!--l. 5937--><p class="noindent" >Coming back to the idea of having been born. You are stuck with
what your parents told you: all about conception, pregnancy and
birth, infant, child, youngster, teenager, and so on. Now, divest
yourself of the idea that you are the body with the help of the
contrary idea that you are not the body. It is also an idea, no
doubt; treat it like something to be abandoned when its work is
done.
<!--l. 5939--><p class="noindent" >The idea that I am not the body gives reality to the body, when in fact,

there is no such thing as body, it is but a state of mind. You can have
as many bodies and as diverse as you like; just remember steadily what
you want and reject the incompatibles.
<!--l. 5941--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am like a box within box, within box, the outer box acting as the
body and the one next to it &#8211;
<!--l. 5943--><p class="noindent" >as the indwelling soul. Abstract the outer box and the next becomes
the body and the one next to it the soul. It is an infinite series, an
endless opening of boxes, is the last one the ultimate soul?
<!--l. 5945--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you have a body, you must have a soul; here your simile of a nest
of boxes applies. But here and now, through all your bodies and souls
shines awareness, the pure light of chit. Hold on to it unswervingly.
Without awareness, the body would not last a second. There is in the
body a current of energy, affection and intelligence, which guides,
maintains and energises the body. Discover that current and stay with
it.
<!--l. 5947--><p class="noindent" >Of course, all these are manners of speaking. Words are as much
a barrier, as a bridge. Find the spark of life that weaves the
tissues of your body and be with it. It is the only reality the body
has.
<!--l. 5949--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What happens to that spark of life after death?
<!--l. 5951--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is beyond time. Birth and death are but points in time. Life
weaves eternally its many webs.
<!--l. 5953--><p class="noindent" >The weaving is in time, but life itself is timeless. Whatever name and
shape you give to its expressions, it is like the ocean &#8211; never changing,
ever changing.
<!--l. 5955--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All you say sounds beautifully convincing. yet my feeling of being

just a person in a world strange and alien, often inimical and
dangerous, does not cease. Being a person, limited in space and time,
how can I possibly realise myself as the opposite; a de-personalised,
universalised awareness of nothing in particular?
<!--l. 5957--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You assert yourself to be what you are not and deny yourself to be
what you are. You omit the element of pure cognition, of awareness free
from all personal distortions. Unless you admit the reality of chit, you
will never know yourself.
<!--l. 5959--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What am I to do? I do not see myself as you see me. Maybe you are
right and I am wrong, but how can I cease to be what I feel I
am?
<!--l. 5961--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A prince who believes himself to be a beggar can be convinced
conclusively in one way only: he must behave as a prince and see
what happens. Behave as if what I say is true and judge by what
actually happens. All I ask is the little faith needed for making the
first step. With experience will come confidence and you will
not need me any more. I know what you are and I am telling
you.
<!--l. 5963--><p class="noindent" >Trust me for a while.
<!--l. 5965--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To be here and now, I need my body and its senses. To understand,
I need a mind.
<!--l. 5967--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The body and the mind are only symptoms of ignorance, of
misapprehension. Behave as if you were pure awareness, bodiless and
mindless, spaceless and timeless, beyond &#8216;where&#8217; and &#8216;when&#8217;
<!--l. 5969--><p class="noindent" >and &#8216;how&#8217;. Dwell on it, think of it, learn to accept its reality. Don&#8217;t
oppose it and deny it all the time.

<!--l. 5971--><p class="noindent" >Keep an open mind at least. Yoga is bending the outer to the inner.
Make your mind and body express the real which is all and beyond all.
By doing you succeed, not by arguing.
<!--l. 5973--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Kindly allow me to come back to my first question. How does the
error of being a person originate?
<!--l. 5975--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The absolute precedes time. Awareness comes first. A bundle of
memories and mental habits attracts attention, awareness gets focalised
and a person suddenly appears. Remove the light of awareness, go to
sleep or swoon away &#8211; and the person disappears. The person ( vyakti)
flickers, awareness ( vyakta) contains all space and time, the absolute (
avyakta) is.

Q: Can you enter into the mind and heart of another man and share his
experience?
<!--l. 5983--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No. Such things require special training. I am like a dealer In
wheat. I know little about breads and cakes. Even the taste of a
wheat-gruel I may not know. But about the wheat grain I know all and
well. I know the source of all experience. But the innumerable
particular forms experience can take I do not know. Nor do I need to

life, I somehow happen to know.

exist in the mind of Brahma?
<!--l. 5987--><p class="noindent" ><span

as a person is a personal matter. A person exists in time and

includes all persons and the absolute is at the root of and beyond
all.
<!--l. 5989--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am not concerned with the totality. My personal consciousness
and your personal consciousness &#8211; what is the link between the

<!--l. 5995--><p class="noindent" ><span

other.
<!--l. 5997--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 5999--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Where are the many points? In your mind. You insist that your
world is independent of your mind. How can it be? Your desire
to know other people&#8217;s minds is due to your not knowing your
own mind. First know your own mind and you will find that the
question of other minds does not arise at all, for there are no other
people. You are the common factor, the only link between the
minds.

But of what use is it to us?
<!--l. 6005--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are like a man who says: &#8216;I need a place where to keep my
things, but of what use is space to me?&#8217; or &#8216;I need milk, tea, coffee or
soda, but for water I have no use&#8217;. Don&#8217;t you see that the Supreme
Reality is what makes everything possible? But if you ask of
what use is it to you, I must answer: &#8216;None&#8217;. In matters of daily
life the knower of the real has no advantage: he may be at a
disadvantage rather: being free from greed and fear, he does not
protect himself. The very idea of profit is foreign to him; he
abhors accretions; his life is constant divesting oneself, sharing,
giving.
<!--l. 6007--><p class="noindent" ><span

trouble?
<!--l. 6009--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is trouble only when you cling to something. When you

hold on to nothing, no trouble arises. The relinquishing of the
lesser is the gaining of the greater. Give up all and you gain
all.
<!--l. 6011--><p class="noindent" >Then life becomes what it was meant to be: pure radiation from an

dreaming?
<!--l. 6019--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Let the dream unroll itself to its very end. You cannot help it. But
you can look at the dream as a dream, refuse it the stamp of
reality.
<!--l. 6021--><p class="noindent" ><span

me talking in my dream.
<!--l. 6023--><p class="noindent" >What is the link between us?
<!--l. 6025--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>My intention to wake you up is the link. My heart wants you
awake. I see you suffer in your dream and I know that you must wake
up to end your woes. When you see your dream as dream, you wake up.
But in your dream itself I am not interested. Enough for me to know

that you must wake up. You need not bring your dream to a definite
conclusion, or make it noble, or happy, or beautiful; all you need is to
realise that you are dreaming. Stop imagining, stop believing. See the
contradictions, the incongruities, the falsehood and the sorrow of the
human state, the need to go beyond. Within the immensity of space
floats a tiny atom of consciousness and in it the entire universe is
contained.
<!--l. 6027--><p class="noindent" ><span

Do they disappear on waking up?
<!--l. 6029--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In dream you love some and not others. On waking up you
find you are love itself, embracing all. Personal love, however
intense and genuine, invariably binds; love in freedom is love of
all.
<!--l. 6031--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>People come and go. One loves whom one meets, one cannot love
all.
<!--l. 6033--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you are love itself, you are beyond time and numbers. In
loving one you love all, in loving all, you love each. One and all are not
exclusive.
<!--l. 6035--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You say you are in a timeless state. Does it mean that past and

Guru?
<!--l. 6037--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The question is in time and about time. Again you are asking me
about the contents of a dream.
<!--l. 6039--><p class="noindent" >Timelessness is beyond the illusion of time, it is not an extension in
time. He who called himself Vashishta knew Vashishta. I am beyond all
names and shapes. Vashishta is a dream in your dream. How can I
know him? You are too much concerned with past and future. It is all

due to your longing to continue, to protect yourself against extinction.
And as you want to continue, you want others to keep you company,
hence your concern with their survival. But what you call survival is
but the survival of a dream. Death is preferable to it . There is a
chance of waking up .
<!--l. 6041--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You are aware of eternity, therefore you are not concerned with
survival.
<!--l. 6043--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is the other way round. Freedom from all desire is eternity. All
attachment implies fear, for all things are transient. And fear makes
one a slave. This freedom from attachment does not come with
practice; it is natural, when one knows one&#8217;s true being. Love does not
cling; clinging is not love.
<!--l. 6045--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So there is no way to gain detachment?
<!--l. 6047--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is nothing to gain. Abandon all imaginings and know
yourself as you are. Self-knowledge is detachment. All craving is due to
a sense of insufficiency. When you know that you lack nothing, that all
there is, is you and yours, desire ceases.
<!--l. 6049--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To know myself must I practise awareness?
<!--l. 6051--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is nothing to practise. To know yourself, be yourself.
To be yourself, stop imagining yourself to be this or that. Just
be. Let your true nature emerge. Don&#8217;t disturb your mind with
seeking.
<!--l. 6053--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6055--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What have you to wait for when it is already here and now? You
have only to look and see.

<!--l. 6057--><p class="noindent" >Look at your self, at your own being. You know that you are and
you like it. Abandon all imagining, that is all. Do not rely on
time. Time is death. Who waits &#8211; dies. Life is now only. Do
not talk to me about past and future &#8211; they exist only in your
mind.

<!--l. 6061--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am dead already. Physical death will make no difference in my
case. I am timeless being. I am free of desire or fear, because I do not
remember the past, or imagine the future. Where there are no names
and shapes, how can there be desire and fear? With desirelessness
comes timelessness. I am safe, because what is not, cannot touch what
is. You feel unsafe, because you imagine danger. Of course, your body
as such is complex and vulnerable and needs protection. But not you.
Once you realise your own unassailable being, you will be at
peace.
<!--l. 6063--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I find peace when the world suffers?
<!--l. 6065--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world suffers for very valid reasons. If you want to help the
world, you must be beyond the need of help. Then all your doing as
well as not doing will help the world most effectively.
<!--l. 6067--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can non-action be of use where action is needed?
<!--l. 6069--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Where action is needed, action happens. Man is not the
actor. His is to be aware of what is going on. His very presence is
action. The window is the absence of the wall and it gives air and
light because it is empty. Be empty of all mental content, of all
imagination and effort, and the very absence of obstacles will
cause reality to rush in. If you really want to help a person,
keep away. If you are emotionally committed to helping, you will
fail to help. You may be very busy and be very pleased with

your charitable nature, but not much will be done. A man is
really helped when he is no longer in need of help. All else is just
futility.
<!--l. 6071--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is not enough time to sit and wait for help to happen. One
must do something.
<!--l. 6073--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means &#8211; do. But what you can do is limited; the self alone is
unlimited. Give limitlessly &#8211;
<!--l. 6075--><p class="noindent" >of yourself. All else you can give in small measures only. You
alone are immeasurable. To help is your very nature. Even when
you eat and drink you help your body. For yourself you need
nothing.
<!--l. 6077--><p class="noindent" >You are pure giving, beginning-less, endless, inexhaustible. When you
see sorrow and suffering, be with it. Do not rush into activity. Neither
learning nor action can really help. Be with sorrow and lay bare its
roots &#8211; helping to understand is real help.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My death is nearing.
<!--l. 6081--><p class="noindent" ><span

find no life nor death in me, only pure being &#8211; not being this or that,
but just being. But the moment the mind, drawing on its stock
of memories, begins to imagine, it fills the space with objects
and time with events. As I do not know even this birth, how
can I know past births? It is the mind that, itself in movement,
sees everything moving, and having created time, worries about
the past and future. All the universe is cradled in consciousness
( maha tattva), which arises where there is perfect order and
harmony ( maha sattva). As all waves are in the ocean, so are
all things physical and mental in awareness. Hence awareness

itself is all important, not the content of it. Deepen and broaden
your awareness of yourself and all the blessings will flow. You
need not seek anything, all will come to you most naturally and
effortlessly.
<!--l. 6105--><p class="noindent" >The five senses and the four functions of the mind &#8211; memory, thought,
understanding and selfhood; the five elements &#8211; earth, water, fire, air
and ether; the two aspects of creation &#8211; matter and spirit, all are
contained in awareness.
<!--l. 6107--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet, you must believe in having lived before.
<!--l. 6109--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The scriptures say so, but I know nothing about it. I know myself
as I am; as I appeared or will appear is not within my experience. It is
not that I do not remember. In fact there is nothing to remember.
Reincarnation implies a reincarnating self. There is no such thing. The
bundle of memories and hopes, called the &#8216;I&#8217;, imagines itself
existing everlastingly and creates time to accommodate its false
eternity: To be, I need no past or future. All experience is born of
imagination; I do not imagine, so no birth or death happens to me.
Only those who think themselves born can think themselves
re-born. You are accusing me of having been born &#8211; I plead not
guilty!
<!--l. 6111--><p class="noindent" >All exists in awareness and awareness neither dies nor is re-born. It is
the changeless reality itself.
<!--l. 6113--><p class="noindent" >All the universe of experience is born with the body and dies with the
body; it has its beginning and end in awareness, but awareness knows
no beginning, nor end. If you think it out carefully and brood over it
for a long time, you will come to see the light of awareness in all its
clarity and the world will fade out of your vision. It is like looking at a
burning incense stick, you see the stick and the smoke first; when
you notice the fiery point, you realise that it has the power to

consume mountains of sticks and fill the universe with smoke.
Timelessly the self actualises itself, without exhausting its infinite
possibilities. In the incense stick simile the stick is the body and
the smoke is the mind. As long as the mind is busy with its
contortions, it does not perceive its own source. The Guru comes and
turns your attention to the spark within. By its very nature the
mind is outward turned; it always tends to seek for the source of
things among the things themselves; to be told to look for the
source within, is, in a way, the beginning of a new life. Awareness
takes the place of consciousness; in consciousness there is the
&#8216;I&#8217;, who is conscious while awareness is undivided; awareness is
aware of itself. The &#8216;I am&#8217; is a thought, while awareness is not a
thought, there is no &#8216;I am aware&#8217; in awareness. Consciousness is
an attribute while awareness is not; one can be aware of being
conscious, but not conscious of awareness. God is the totality of
consciousness, but awareness is beyond all &#8211; being as well as
not-being.
<!--l. 6115--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I had started with the question about the condition of a
man after death. When his body is destroyed, what happens to
his consciousness? Does he carry his senses of seeing, hearing
etc.
<!--l. 6117--><p class="noindent" >along with him or does he leave them behind? And, if he loses his
senses, what becomes to his consciousness?
<!--l. 6119--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Senses are mere modes of perception. As the grosser modes
disappear, finer states of consciousness emerge.
<!--l. 6121--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no transition to awareness after death?
<!--l. 6123--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There can be no transition from consciousness to awareness, for
awareness is not a form of consciousness. Consciousness can only
become more subtle and refined and that is what happens after death.

As the various vehicles of man die off, the modes of consciousness
induced by them also fade away.
<!--l. 6125--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Until only unconsciousness remains?
<!--l. 6127--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Look at yourself talking of unconsciousness as something that
comes and goes! Who is there to be conscious of unconsciousness? As
long as the window is open, there is sunlight in the room.
<!--l. 6129--><p class="noindent" >With the windows shut, the sun remains, but does it see the darkness
in the room? Is there anything like darkness to the sun? There is
no such thing as unconsciousness, for unconsciousness is not
experienceable. We infer unconsciousness when there is a lapse in
memory or communication. If I stop reacting, you will say that I am
unconscious. In reality I may be most acutely conscious, only unable to
communicate or remember.
<!--l. 6131--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am asking a simple question: there are about four billion people
in the world and they are all bound to die. What will be their
condition after death &#8211; not physically, but psychologically? Will
their consciousness continue? And if it does, in what form? Do
not tell me that I am not asking the right question, or that you
do not know the answer, or that in your world my question is
meaningless; the moment you start talking about your world and my
world as different and incompatible, you build a wall between us.
Either we live in one world or your experience is of no use to
us.
<!--l. 6133--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course we live in one world. Only I see it as it is, while you
don&#8217;t. You see yourself in the world, while I see the world in myself. To
you, you get born and die, while to me, the world appears and
disappears. Our world is real, but your view of it is not. There is no
wall between us, except the one built by you. There is nothing
wrong with the senses, it is your imagination that misleads you. It

covers up the world as it is, with what you imagine it to be &#8211;
something existing independently of you and yet closely following your
inherited, or acquired patterns. There is a deep contradiction in your
attitude, which you do not see and which is the cause of sorrow.
You cling to the idea that you were born into a world of pain
and sorrow; I know that the world is a child of love, having its
beginning, growth and fulfilment in love. But I am beyond love
even.
<!--l. 6135--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If you have created the world out of love, why is it so full of
pain?
<!--l. 6137--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are right &#8211; from the body&#8217;s point of view. But you are not
the body. You are the immensity and infinity of consciousness.
Don&#8217;t assume what is not true and you will see things as I see
them.
<!--l. 6139--><p class="noindent" >Pain and pleasure, good and bad, right and wrong: these are relative
terms and must not be taken absolutely. They are limited and
temporary.
<!--l. 6141--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In the Buddhist tradition it is stated that a Nirvani, an enlightened
Buddha, has the freedom of the universe. He can know and experience
for himself all that exists. He can command, interfere with nature, with
the chain of causation, change the sequence of events, even undo the
past! The world is still with him but he is free in it.
<!--l. 6143--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What you describe is God. Of course, where there is a universe,
there will also be its counterpart, which is God. But I am beyond both.
There was a kingdom in search of a king. They found the right
man and made him king. In no way had he changed. He was
merely given the title, the rights and the duties of a king. His
nature was not affected, only his actions. Similarly, with the
enlightened man; the content of his consciousness undergoes

a radical transformation. But he is not misled. He knows the
changeless.
<!--l. 6145--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The changeless cannot be conscious. Consciousness is always of
change. The changeless leaves no trace in consciousness.
<!--l. 6147--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes and no. The paper is not the writing, yet it carries the writing.
The ink is not the message, nor is the reader&#8217;s mind the message &#8211; but
they all make the message possible.
<!--l. 6149--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does consciousness come down from reality or is it an attribute of
matter?
<!--l. 6151--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness as such is the subtle counterpart of matter. Just as
inertia ( tamas) and energy ( rajas) are attributes of matter, so does
harmony ( sattva) manifest itself as consciousness. You may consider
it in a way as a form of very subtle energy. Wherever matter
organises itself into a stable organism, consciousness appears
spontaneously. With the destruction of the organism consciousness
disappears.
<!--l. 6153--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then what survives?
<!--l. 6155--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That, of which matter and consciousness are but aspects, which is
neither born nor dies.
<!--l. 6157--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If it is beyond matter and consciousness, how can it be experienced?
<!--l. 6159--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It can be known by its effects on both; look for it in beauty and in
bliss. But you will understand neither body nor consciousness, unless
you go beyond both.
<!--l. 6161--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Please tell us squarely: are you conscious or unconscious?

<!--l. 6163--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The enlightened ( jnani) is neither. But in his enlightenment (
jnana) all is contained. Awareness contains every experience. But he
who is aware is beyond every experience. He is beyond awareness
itself.
<!--l. 6165--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is the background of experience, call it matter. There is the
experiencer, call it mind.
<!--l. 6167--><p class="noindent" >What makes the bridge between the two?
<!--l. 6169--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The very gap between is the bridge. That, which at one end looks
like matter and at the other as mind, is in itself the bridge. Don&#8217;t
separate reality into mind and body and there will be no need of
bridges.
<!--l. 6171--><p class="noindent" >Consciousness arising, the world arises. When you consider the wisdom
and the beauty of the world, you call it God. Know the source of it
all, which is in yourself, and you will find all your questions
answered.
<!--l. 6173--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The seer and the seen: are they one or two?
<!--l. 6175--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is only seeing; both the seer and the seen are contained in it.
Don&#8217;t create differences where there are none.
<!--l. 6177--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I began with the question about the man who died. You said that
his experiences will shape themselves according to his expectations and
beliefs.
<!--l. 6179--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Before you were born you expected to live according to a plan,
which you yourself had laid down. Your own will was the backbone of
your destiny.
<!--l. 6181--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6183--><p class="noindent" ><span

Ultimately your character shapes your life and you alone can shape
your character.

<!--l. 6187--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By seeing it as it is, and being sincerely sorry. This integral
seeing-feeling can work miracles. It is like casting a bronze image; metal
alone, or fire alone will not do; nor will the mould be of any use; you
have to melt down the metal in the heat of the fire and cast it in the
mould.

<!--l. 6191--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I see you sitting in your son&#8217;s house waiting for
lunch to be served. And I wonder whether the content of your
consciousness is similar to mine, or partly different, or totally
different.
<!--l. 6193--><p class="noindent" >Are you hungry and thirsty as I am, waiting rather impatiently for the
meals to be served, or are you in an altogether different state of
mind?
<!--l. 6195--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>There is not much difference on the surface, but very much
of it in depth. You know yourself only through the senses and the mind.
You take yourself to be what they suggest; having no direct knowledge
of yourself, you have mere ideas; all mediocre, second-hand, by
hearsay.
<!--l. 6197--><p class="noindent" >Whatever you think you are you take it to be true; the habit of
imagining yourself perceivable and describable is very strong with
you.
<!--l. 6199--><p class="noindent" >I see as you see, hear as you hear, taste as you taste, eat as you eat. I
also feel thirst and hunger and expect my food to be served on time.
When starved or sick, my body and mind go weak. All this I perceive
quite clearly, but somehow I am not in it, I feel myself as if floating
over it, aloof and detached. Even not aloof and detached. There is
aloofness and detachment as there is thirst and hunger; there is also the
awareness of it all and a sense of Immense distance, as if the body and
the mind and all that happens to them were somewhere far out on
the horizon. I am like a cinema screen &#8211; clear and empty &#8211; the
pictures pass over it and disappear, leaving it as clear and empty as
before. In no way is the screen affected by the pictures, nor are
the pictures affected by the screen. The screen intercepts and
reflects the pictures, it does not shape them. It has nothing to do

with the rolls of films. These are as they are, lumps of destiny (
prarabdha), but not my destiny; the destinies of the people on the
screen.
<!--l. 6201--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You do not mean to say that the people in a picture have destinies!
They belong to the story, the story is not theirs.
<!--l. 6203--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>And what about you? Do you shape your life or are you shaped by
it?
<!--l. 6205--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, you are right. A life story unrolls itself of which I am one of the
actors. I have no being outside it, as it has no being without me. I am
merely a character, not a person.
<!--l. 6207--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The character will become a person, when he begins to shape his
life instead of accepting it as it comes, and identifying himself with
it.
<!--l. 6209--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6211--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6215--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When you say: clear and empty, what do you mean?
<!--l. 6217--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I mean free of all contents. To myself I am neither perceivable nor
conceivable; there is nothing I can point out and say: &#8216;this I am&#8217;. You
identify yourself with everything so easily, I find it impossible. The
feeling: &#8216;I am not this or that, nor is anything mine&#8217; is so strong in me
that as soon as a thing or a thought appears, there comes at once the
sense &#8216;this I am not&#8217;.

<!--l. 6219--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you mean to say that you spend your time repeating &#8216;this I am
not, that I am not&#8217;?
<!--l. 6221--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course not. I am merely verbalizing for your sake. By the grace
of my Guru I have realised once and for good that I am neither
object nor subject and I do not need to remind myself all the
time.
<!--l. 6223--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find it hard to grasp what exactly do you mean by saying that you
are neither the object nor the subject. At this very moment, as
we talk, am I not the object of your experience, and you the
subject?
<!--l. 6225--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Look, my thumb touches my forefinger. Both touch and are
touched. When my attention; is on the thumb, the thumb is the feeler
and the forefinger &#8211; the self. Shift the focus of attention and
the relationship is reversed. I find that somehow, by shifting
the focus of attention, I become the very thing I look at and
experience the kind of consciousness it has; I become the inner
witness of the thing. I call this capacity of entering other focal
points of consciousness &#8211; love; you may give it any name you
like. Love says: &#8216;I am everything&#8217;. Wisdom says: &#8216;I am nothing&#8217;
Between the two my life flows. Since at any point of time and
space I can be both the subject and the object of experience, I
express it by saying that I am both, and neither, and beyond
both.
<!--l. 6227--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You make all these extraordinary statements about yourself. What
makes you say those things? What do you mean by saying that you are
beyond space and time?
<!--l. 6229--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You ask and the answer comes. I watch myself &#8211; I watch the answer
and see no contradiction.

<!--l. 6231--><p class="noindent" >It is clear to me that I am telling you the truth. It is all very simple.
Only you must trust me that I mean what I say, that I am quite
serious. As I told you already, my Guru showed me my true
nature
<!--l. 6233--><p class="noindent" >&#8211; and the true nature of the world. Having realised that I am one with,
and yet beyond the world, I became free from all desire and
fear. I did not reason out that I should be free &#8211; I found myself
free
<!--l. 6235--><p class="noindent" >&#8211; unexpectedly, without the least effort. This freedom from desire and
fear remained with me since then. Another thing I noticed was that I
do not need to make an effort; the deed follows the thought,
without delay and friction. I have also found that thoughts become
self-fulfilling; things would fall in place smoothly and rightly. The main
change was in the mind; it became motionless and silent, responding
quickly, but not perpetuating the response. Spontaneity became a way
of life, the real became natural and the natural became real. And above
all, infinite affection, love, dark and quiet, radiating in all directions,
embracing all, making all interesting and beautiful, significant and
auspicious.
<!--l. 6237--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are told that various Yogic powers arise spontaneously in a man
who has realised his own true being. What is your experience in these
matters?
<!--l. 6239--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Man&#8217;s fivefold body (physical etc.) has potential powers beyond our
wildest dreams. Not only is the entire universe reflected in man, but
also the power to control the universe is waiting to be used by him. The
wise man is not anxious to use such powers, except when the situation
calls for them.
<!--l. 6241--><p class="noindent" >He finds the abilities and skills of the human personality quite adequate
for the business of daily living. Some of the powers can be developed by

specialised training, but the man who flaunts such powers is still in
bondage. The wise man counts nothing as his own. When at some time
and place some miracle is attributed to some person, he will not
establish any causal link between events and people, nor will he allow
any conclusions to be drawn. All happened as it happened because it
had to happen everything happens as it does, because the universe is as
it is.
<!--l. 6243--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The universe does not seem a happy place to live in. Why is there
so much suffering?
<!--l. 6245--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pain is physical; suffering is mental. Beyond the mind there is no
suffering. Pain is merely a signal that the body is in danger and
requires attention. Similarly, suffering warns us that the structure of
memories and habits, which we call the person ( vyakti), is threatened
by loss or change. Pain is essential for the survival of the body, but
none compels you to suffer. Suffering is due entirely to clinging or
resisting; it is a sign of our unwillingness to move on, to flow with
life.
<!--l. 6247--><p class="noindent" >As a sane life is free of pain, so is a saintly life free from suffering.

<!--l. 6251--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Did they tell you, or do you say so on your own? The essence of
saintliness is total acceptance of the present moment, harmony with
things as they happen. A saint does not want things to be different
from what they are; he knows that, considering all factors, they are
unavoidable. He is friendly with the inevitable and,. therefore, does not
suffer. Pain he may know, but it does not shatter him. If he can, he
does the needful to restore the lost balance &#8211; or he lets things take
their course.
<!--l. 6253--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>He may die.

<!--l. 6255--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So what? What does he gain by living on and what does he lose by
dying? What was born, must die; what was never born cannot die. It
all depends on what he takes himself to be.
<!--l. 6257--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Imagine you fall mortally ill. Would you not regret and resent?
<!--l. 6259--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But I am dead already, or, rather, neither alive nor dead. You
see my body behaving the habitual way and draw your own
conclusions. You will not admit that your conclusions bind nobody but
you. Do see that the image you have of me may be altogether
wrong. Your image of yourself is wrong too, but that is your
problem. But you need not create problems for me and then ask
me to solve them. I am neither creating problems nor solving
them.

me?
<!--l. 6265--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>The very fact of observation alters the observer and the
observed. After all, what prevents the insight into one&#8217;s true nature is
the weakness and obtuseness of the mind and its tendency to skip the
subtle and focus on the gross only. When you follow my advice and try
to keep your mind on the notion of &#8216;I am&#8217; only, you become fully aware
of your mind and its vagaries. Awareness, being lucid harmony (
sattva) in action, dissolves dullness and quietens the restlessness of the
mind and gently, but steadily changes its very substance. This change
need not be spectacular; it may be hardly noticeable; yet it is a deep
and fundamental shift from darkness to light, from inadvertence to
awareness.

as a mother takes her child to a teacher. Trust and obey your Guru, for
he is the messenger of your Real Self.
<!--l. 6279--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do I find a Guru whom I can trust?
<!--l. 6281--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your own heart will tell you. There is no difficulty in finding a
Guru, because the Guru is in search of you. The Guru is always ready;
you are not ready. You have to be ready to learn; or you may
meet your Guru and waste your chance by sheer inattentiveness
and obstinacy. Take my example; there was nothing in me of
much promise, but when I met my Guru, I listened, trusted and
obeyed.
<!--l. 6283--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must I not examine the teacher before I put myself entirely into his
hands?
<!--l. 6285--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means examine! But what can you find out? Only as he
appears to you on your own level.
<!--l. 6287--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I shall watch whether he is consistent, whether there is harmony
between his life and his teaching.
<!--l. 6289--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You may find plenty of disharmony &#8211; so what? It proves nothing.
Only motives matter. How will you know his motives?

<!--l. 6291--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I should at least expect him to be a man of self-control who lives a
righteous life.
<!--l. 6293--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Such you will find many &#8211; and of no use to you. A Guru can
show the way back home, to your real self. What has this to do
with the character, or temperament of the person he appears to
be?
<!--l. 6295--><p class="noindent" >Does he not clearly tell you that he is not the person? The only way
you can judge is by the change in yourself when you are in his
company. If you feel more at peace and happy, if you understand
yourself with more than usual clarity and depth, it means you have met
the right man. Take your time, but once you have made up your mind
to trust him, trust him absolutely and follow every instruction fully and
faithfully. It does not matter much if you do not accept him as your
Guru and are satisfied with his company only. Satsang alone can also
take you to your goal, provided it is unmixed and undisturbed. But
once you accept somebody as your Guru, listen, remember and
obey. Half-heartedness is a serious drawback and the cause of
much self-created sorrow. The mistake is never the Guru&#8217;s; it is
always the obtuseness and cussedness of the discipline that is at
fault.
<!--l. 6297--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does the Guru then dismiss, or disqualify a disciple?
<!--l. 6299--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He would not be a Guru if he did! He bides his time and waits till
the disciple, chastened and sobered, comes back to him in a more
receptive mood.
<!--l. 6301--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the motive? Why does the Guru take so much trouble?
<!--l. 6303--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Sorrow and the ending of sorrow. He sees people suffering in their
dreams and he wants them to wake up. Love is intolerant of pain and
suffering. The patience of a Guru has no limits and, therefore, it cannot

be defeated. The Guru never fails.
<!--l. 6305--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is my first Guru also my last, or do I have to pass from Guru to
Guru?
<!--l. 6307--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The entire universe is your Guru. You learn from everything, if you
are alert and intelligent.
<!--l. 6309--><p class="noindent" >Were your mind clear and your heart clean, you would learn from every
passer-by;. It is because you are indolent or restless, that your inner
Self manifests as the outer Guru and makes you trust him and
obey.
<!--l. 6311--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is a Guru inevitable?
<!--l. 6313--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is like asking &#8216;Is a mother inevitable?&#8217; To rise in consciousness
from one dimension to another, you need help. The help may not
always be in the shape of a human person, it may be a subtle presence,
or a spark of intuition, but help must come. The inner Self is watching
and waiting for the son to return to his father. At the right time
he arranges everything affectionately and effectively. Where a
messenger is needed, or a guide, he sends the Guru to do the
needful.
<!--l. 6315--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is one thing I cannot grasp. You speak of the inner self as
wise and good and beautiful and in every way perfect, and of the
person as mere reflection without a being of its own. On the other hand
you take so much trouble in helping the person to realise itself. If the
person is so unimportant, why be so concerned with its welfare? Who
cares for a shadow?
<!--l. 6317--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have brought in duality where there is none. There is the body
and there is the Self.

<!--l. 6319--><p class="noindent" >Between them is the mind, in which the Self is reflected as &#8216;I am&#8217;.
Because of the imperfections of the mind, its crudity and restlessness,
lack of discernment and insight, it takes itself to be the body, not the
Self. All that is needed is to purify the mind so that it can realise its
identity with the Self.
<!--l. 6321--><p class="noindent" >When the mind merges in the Self, the body presents no problems. It
remains what it is, an instrument of cognition and action, the tool and
the expression of the creative fire within: The ultimate value of the
body is that it serves to discover the cosmic body, which is the
universe in its entirety. As you realise yourself in manifestation, you
keep on discovering that you are ever more than what you have
imagined.
<!--l. 6323--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no end to self-discovery?
<!--l. 6325--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As there is no beginning, there is no end. But what I have
discovered by the grace of my Guru is: I am nothing that can be
pointed at. I am neither a &#8216;this&#8217; nor a &#8216;that&#8217;. This holds absolutely.
<!--l. 6327--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then, where comes in the never-ending discovery, the endless
transcending oneself into hew dimensions?
<!--l. 6329--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All this belongs to the realm of manifestation; it is in the very
structure of the universe, that the higher can be had only through the
freedom from the lower.
<!--l. 6331--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is lower and what is higher?
<!--l. 6333--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Look at it in terms of awareness. Wider and deeper consciousness is
higher. All that lives, works for protecting, perpetuating and expanding
consciousness. This is the world&#8217;s sole meaning and purpose. It is the
very essence of Yoga &#8211; ever raising the level of consciousness, discovery
of new dimensions, with their properties, qualities and powers.

In that sense the entire universe becomes a school of Yoga (
yogakshetra).
<!--l. 6335--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is perfection the destiny of all human beings?
<!--l. 6337--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of all living beings &#8211; ultimately. The possibility becomes a
certainty when the notion of enlightenment appears in the mind. Once
a living being has heard and understood that deliverance is within his
reach, he will never forget, for it is the first message from within. It will
take roots and grow and in due course take the blessed shape of the
Guru.
<!--l. 6339--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So all we are concerned with is the redemption of the mind?
<!--l. 6341--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else? The mind goes astray, the mind returns home. Even the
word &#8216;astray&#8217; is not proper.
<!--l. 6343--><p class="noindent" >The mind must know itself in every mood. Nothing is a mistake unless

 id="x1-6400059"></a>Desire and Fear: Self-centred States</h2>
<!--l. 6347--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I would like to go again into the question of pleasure and
pain, desire and fear. I understand fear which is memory and
anticipation of pain. It is essential for the preservation of the organism
and its living pattern. Needs, when felt, are painful and their
anticipation is full of fear; we are rightly afraid of not being able
to meet our basic needs. The relief experienced when a need
is met, or an anxiety allayed is entirely due to the ending of
pain. We may give it positive names like pleasure, or joy, or
happiness, but essentially it is relief from pain. It is this fear
of pain that holds together our social, economic and political
institutions.
<!--l. 6349--><p class="noindent" >What puzzles me is that we derive pleasure from things and
states of mind, which have nothing to do with survival. On the
contrary, our pleasures are usually destructive. They damage
or destroy the object, the instrument and also the subject of
pleasure. Otherwise, pleasure and pursuit of pleasure would be
no problem. This brings me to the core of my question: why is
pleasure destructive? Why, in spite of its destructiveness, is it
wanted?
<!--l. 6351--><p class="noindent" >I may add, I do not have in mind the pleasure-pain pattern by which
nature compels us to go her way. I think of the man-made pleasures,
both sensory and subtle, ranging from the grossest, like overeating, to
the most refined. Addiction to pleasure, at whatever cost, is so
universal that there must be something significant at the root of
it.
<!--l. 6353--><p class="noindent" >Of course, not every activity of man must be utilitarian, designed to
meet a need. Play, for example, is natural and man is the most playful
animal in existence. Play fulfils the need for self-discovery and
self-development. But even on his play man becomes destructive of

nature, others and himself.
<!--l. 6355--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>In short, you do not object to pleasure, but only to its price
in pain and sorrow.
<!--l. 6357--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If reality itself is bliss, then pleasure in some way must be related to
it.
<!--l. 6359--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Let us not proceed by verbal logic. The bliss of reality does not
exclude suffering. Besides, you know only pleasure, not the bliss of pure
being. So let us examine pleasure at its own level.
<!--l. 6361--><p class="noindent" >If you look at yourself in your moments of pleasure or pain, you will
invariably find that it is not the thing in itself that is pleasant or
painful, but the situation of which it is a part. Pleasure lies in the
relationship between the enjoyer and the enjoyed. And the essence of it
is acceptance. Whatever may be the situation, if it is acceptable, it is
pleasant. If it is not acceptable, it is painful. What makes it acceptable
is not important; the cause may be physical, or psychological, or
untraceable; acceptance is the decisive factor. Obversely, suffering is
due to non-acceptance.
<!--l. 6363--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Pain is not acceptable.
<!--l. 6365--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why not? Did you ever try? Do try and you will find in pain
a joy which pleasure cannot yield, for the simple reason that
acceptance of pain takes you much deeper than pleasure does. The
personal self by its very nature is constantly pursuing pleasure and
avoiding pain. The ending of this pattern is the ending of the self.
The ending of the self with its desires and fears enables you
to return to your real nature, the source of all happiness and
peace. The perennial desire for pleasure is the reflection of the
timeless harmony within. It is an observable fact that one becomes
selfconscious only when caught in the conflict between pleasure and

pain, which demands choice and decision. It is this clash between
desire and fear that causes anger, which is the great destroyer of
sanity in life. When pain is accepted for what it is, a lesson and
a warning, and deeply looked into and heeded, the separation
between pain and pleasure breaks down, both become experience
&#8211;
<!--l. 6367--><p class="noindent" >painful when resisted, joyful when accepted.
<!--l. 6369--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you advise shunning pleasure and pursuing pain?
<!--l. 6371--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No, nor pursuing pleasure and shunning pain. Accept both
as they come, enjoy both while they last, let them go, as they
must.
<!--l. 6373--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I possibly enjoy pain? Physical pain calls for action.
<!--l. 6375--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. And so does Mental. The bliss is in the awareness of it,
in not shrinking, or in any way turning away from it. All happiness
comes from awareness. The more we are conscious, the deeper the joy.
Acceptance of pain, non-resistance, courage and endurance &#8211;
these open deep and perennial sources of real happiness, true
bliss.
<!--l. 6377--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should pain be more effective than pleasure?
<!--l. 6379--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pleasure is readily accepted, while all the powers of the self reject
pain. As the acceptance of pain is the denial of the self, and the self
stands in the way of true happiness, the wholehearted acceptance of
pain releases the springs of happiness.
<!--l. 6381--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does the acceptance of suffering act the same way?
<!--l. 6383--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The fact of pain is easily brought within the focus of awareness.

With suffering it is not that simple. To focus suffering is not enough,
for mental life, as we know it, is one continuous stream of suffering. To
reach the deeper layers of suffering you must go to its roots and
uncover their vast underground network, where fear and desire are
closely interwoven and the currents of life&#8217;s energy oppose, obstruct and
destroy each other.
<!--l. 6385--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I set right a tangle which is entirely below the level of my
consciousness?
<!--l. 6387--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By being with yourself, the &#8216;I am&#8217;; by watching yourself in your
daily life with alert interest, with the intention to understand
rather than to judge, in full acceptance of whatever may emerge,
because it is there, you encourage the deep to come to the surface
and enrich your life and consciousness with its captive energies.
This is the great work of awareness; it removes obstacles and
releases energies by understanding the nature of life and mind.
Intelligence is the door to freedom and alert attention is the mother of
intelligence.
<!--l. 6389--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>One more question. Why does pleasure end in pain?
<!--l. 6391--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everything has a beginning and an end and so does pleasure. Don&#8217;t
anticipate and don&#8217;t regret, and there will be no pain. it is memory and
imagination that cause suffering.
<!--l. 6393--><p class="noindent" >Of course pain after pleasure may be due to the misuse of the body or
the mind. The body knows its measure, but the mind does not. Its
appetites are numberless and limitless. Watch your mind with
great diligence, for there lies your bondage and also the key to
freedom.
<!--l. 6395--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My question is not yet fully answered: Why are man&#8217;s pleasures
destructive? Why does he find so much pleasure in destruction? Life&#8217;s

concern lies in protection, perpetuation and expansion of itself. In this
it is guided by pain and pleasure. At what point do they become
destructive?
<!--l. 6397--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When the mind takes over, remembers and anticipates, it
exaggerates, it distorts, it overlooks.
<!--l. 6399--><p class="noindent" >The past is projected into future and the future betrays the
expectations. The organs of sensation and action are stimulated beyond
capacity and they inevitably break down. The objects of pleasure
cannot yield what is expected of them and get worn out, or destroyed,
by misuse. It results in excess of pain where pleasure was looked
for.
<!--l. 6401--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We destroy not only ourselves, but others too!
<!--l. 6403--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Naturally, selfishness is always destructive. Desire and fear, both
are self-centred states.
<!--l. 6405--><p class="noindent" >Between desire and fear anger arises, with anger hatred, with hatred
passion for destruction. War is hatred in action, organised and
equipped with all the instruments of death.
<!--l. 6407--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there a way to end these horrors?
<!--l. 6409--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When more people come to know their real nature, their
influence, however subtle, will prevail and the world&#8217;s emotional
atmosphere will sweeten up. People follow their leaders and when
among the leaders appear some, great in heart and mind, and
absolutely free from self-seeking, their impact will be enough to
make the crudities and crimes of the present age impossible.
A new golden age may come and last for a time and succumb
to its own perfection. For, ebb begins when the tide is at its
highest.

<!--l. 6411--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no such thing as permanent perfection?
<!--l. 6413--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, there is, but it includes all imperfection. It is the perfection of
our self-nature which makes everything possible, perceivable,
interesting. It knows no suffering, for it neither likes nor dislikes;
neither accepts nor rejects. Creation and destruction are the two poles
between which it weaves its ever-changing pattern. Be free from
predilections and preferences and the mind with its burden of sorrow
will be no more.
<!--l. 6415--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But I am not alone to suffer. There are others.
<!--l. 6417--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you go to them with your desires and fears, you merely
add to their sorrows. First be free of suffering yourself and then
only hope of helping others. You do not even need to hope &#8211;
your very existence will be the greatest help a man can give his
fellowmen.

it?

<!--l. 6491--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It does &#8211; in my real world. In my world even what you call evil is
the servant of the good and therefore necessary. It is like boils and
fevers that clear the body of impurities. Disease is painful, even
dangerous, but if dealt with rightly, it heals.

<!--l. 6493--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Or kills.
<!--l. 6495--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In some cases death is the best cure. A life may be worse than
death, which is but rarely an unpleasant experience, whatever the
appearances. Therefore, pity the living, never the dead. This problem
of things, good and evil in themselves, does not exist in my world. The
needful is good and the needless is evil. In your world the pleasant is
good and the painful is evil.
<!--l. 6497--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is necessary?
<!--l. 6499--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To grow is necessary. To outgrow is necessary. To leave behind the
good for the sake of the better is necessary.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To what end?
<!--l. 6503--><p class="noindent" ><span

Absolute.

<!--l. 6507--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whose trouble? Which trouble? Do you pity the seed that is to
grow and multiply till it becomes a mighty forest? Do you kill an
infant to save him from the bother of living? What is wrong with
life, ever more life? Remove the obstacles to growing and all
your personal, social, economic and political problems will just
dissolve. The universe is perfect as a whole and the part&#8217;s striving
for perfection is a way of joy. Willingly sacrifice the imperfect
to the perfect and there will be no more talk about good and
evil.
<!--l. 6509--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6514--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I was lucky to have holy company all my life. Is it enough
for self-realisation?
<!--l. 6516--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>It depends what you make of it.
<!--l. 6518--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I was told that the liberating action of satsang is automatic. Just
like a river carries one to the estuary, so the subtle and silent influence
of good people will take me to reality.
<!--l. 6520--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It will take you to the river, but the crossing is your own. Freedom
cannot be gained nor kept without will-to-freedom. You must strive for
liberation; the least you can do is uncover and remove the obstacles
diligently. If you want peace you must strive for it. You will not get
peace just by keeping quiet.
<!--l. 6522--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A child just grows. He does not make plans for growth, nor has he a
pattern; nor does he grow by fragments, a hand here a leg there; he
grows integrally and unconsciously.
<!--l. 6524--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because he is free of imagination. You can also grow like this, but
you must not indulge in forecasts and plans, born of memory and
anticipation. It is one of the peculiarities of a jnani that he is not
concerned with the future. Your concern with future is due to fear of
pain and desire for pleasure, to the jnani all is bliss: he is happy with
whatever comes.
<!--l. 6526--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, there are many things that would make even a jnani
miserable M: A jnani may meet with difficulties, but they do not make
him suffer. Bringing up a child from birth to maturity may seem a hard
task, but to a mother the memories of hardships are a joy. There is
nothing wrong with the world. What is wrong is in the way you look at
it. It is your own imagination that misleads you. Without imagination

there is no world. Your conviction that you are conscious of a world is
the world. The world you perceive is made of consciousness;
what you call matter is consciousness Itself. You are the space (
akash) in which it moves, the time in which it lasts, the love
that gives it life. Cut off imagination and attachment and what
remains?
<!--l. 6528--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The world remains. I remain.
<!--l. 6530--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes. But how different it is when you can see it as it is, not through
the screen of desire and fear.
<!--l. 6532--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What for are all these distinctions &#8211; reality and illusion, wisdom
and ignorance, saint and sinner? Everyone is in search of happiness,
everyone strives desperately; everyone is a Yogi and his life a school of
wisdom. Each learns his own way the lessons he needs. Society
approves of some, disapproves of others; there are no rules that apply
everywhere and for all time.
<!--l. 6534--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In my world love is the only law. I do not ask for love, I give it.
Such is my nature.
<!--l. 6536--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I see you living your life according to a pattern. You run a
meditation class in the morning, lecture and have discussions
regularly; twice daily there is worship ( puja) and religious singing
( bhajan) in the evening. You seem to adhere to the routine
scrupulously.
<!--l. 6538--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The worship and the singing are as I found them and I saw
no reason to interfere. The general routine is according to the
wishes of the people with whom I happen to live or who come to
listen.
<!--l. 6540--><p class="noindent" >They are working people, with many obligations and the timings are

for their convenience. Some repetitive routine is inevitable. Even
animals and plants have their time-tables.
<!--l. 6542--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, we see a regular sequence in all life. Who maintains the
order? Is there an inner ruler, who lays down laws and enforces
order?
<!--l. 6544--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everything moves according to its nature. Where is the need of
a policeman? Every action creates a reaction, which balances
and neutralises the action. Everything happens, but there is
a continuous cancelling out, and in the end it is as if nothing
happened.
<!--l. 6546--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do not console me with final harmonies. The accounts tally, but the
loss is mine.
<!--l. 6548--><p class="noindent" ><span

the outlays.
<!--l. 6550--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is a long life behind me and I often wonder whether its many
events took place by accident, or there was a plan. Was there a pattern
laid down before I was born by which I had to live my life? If yes, who
made the plans and who enforced them? Could there be deviations
and mistakes? Some say destiny is immutable and every second
of life is predetermined; others say that pure accident decides
everything.
<!--l. 6552--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can have it as you like. You can distinguish in your life a
pattern or see merely a chain of accidents. Explanations are meant to
please the mind. They need not be true. Reality is indefinable and
indescribable.
<!--l. 6554--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, you are escaping my question! I want to know how you look at
it. Wherever we look we find structure of unbelievable intelligence and

beauty. How can I believe that the universe is formless and chaotic?
Your world, the world in which you live, may be formless, but it need
not be chaotic.
<!--l. 6556--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The objective universe has structure, is orderly and beautiful.
Nobody can deny it. But structure and pattern, imply constraint
and compulsion. My world is absolutely free; everything in it is
self-determined. Therefore I keep on saying that all happens by itself.
There is order in my world too, but it is not Imposed from outside. It
comes spontaneously and immediately, because of its timelessness.
Perfection is not in the future. It is now.
<!--l. 6558--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does your world affect mine?
<!--l. 6560--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>At one point only &#8211; at the point of the now. It gives it momentary
being, a fleeting sense of reality. In full awareness the contact is
established. It needs effortless, un-self-conscious attention.
<!--l. 6562--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not attention an attitude of mind?
<!--l. 6564--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, when the mind is eager for reality, it gives attention. There is
nothing wrong with your world, it is your thinking yourself to be
separate from it that creates disorder. Selfishness is the source of all
evil.
<!--l. 6566--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am coming back to my question. Before I was born, did my inner
self decide the details of my life, or was it entirely accidental and at the
mercy of heredity and circumstances?
<!--l. 6568--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Those who claim to have selected their father and mother and
decided how they are going to live their next life may know for
themselves. I know for myself. I was never born.
<!--l. 6570--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6572--><p class="noindent" ><span

die.
<!--l. 6574--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is the life-story of thus body-mind that I am interested in.
Was it laid down by you or somebody else, or did it happen
accidentally?
<!--l. 6576--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is a catch in your very question. I make no distinction
between the body and the universe.
<!--l. 6578--><p class="noindent" >Each is the cause of the other; each is the other, in truth. But I am out
of it all. When I am telling you that I was never born, why go on
asking me what were my preparations for the next birth? The
moment you allow your imagination to spin, it at once spins out a
universe. It is not at all as you imagine and I am not bound by your
imaginings.
<!--l. 6580--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It requires intelligence and energy to build and maintain a living
body. Where do they come from?
<!--l. 6582--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is only imagination. The intelligence and power are all used
up in your imagination. It has absorbed you so completely that you
just cannot grasp how far from reality you have wandered. No doubt
imagination is richly creative. Universe within universe are built on it.
Yet they are all in space and time, past and future, which just do not
exist.
<!--l. 6584--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have read recently a report about a little girl who was very cruelly
handled in her early childhood. She was badly mutilated and disfigured
and grew up in an orphanage, completely estranged from its
surroundings. This little girl was quiet and obedient, but completely
indifferent.
<!--l. 6586--><p class="noindent" >One of the nuns who were looking after the children, was convinced

that the girl was not mentally retarded, but merely withdrawn,
irresponsive. A psychoanalyst was asked to take up the case and for full
two years he would see the child once a week and try to break the
wall of isolation. She was docile and well-behaved, but would
give no attention to her doctor. He brought her a toy house,
with rooms and movable furniture and dolls representing father,
mother and their children. It brought out a response, the girl
got interested. One day the old hurts revived and came to the
surface.
<!--l. 6588--><p class="noindent" >Gradually she recovered, a number of operations brought back her face
and body to normal and she grew into an efficient and attractive young
woman. It took the doctor more than five years, but the work was
done. He was a real Guru! He did not put down conditions nor talk
about readiness and eligibility. Without faith, without hope, out of love
only he tried and tried again.
<!--l. 6590--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, that is the nature of a Guru. He will never give up. But, to
succeed, he must not be met with too much resistance. Doubt and
disobedience necessarily delay. Given confidence and pliability, he can
bring about a radical change in the disciple speedily. Deep insight in
the Guru and earnestness in the disciple, both are needed. Whatever
was her condition, the girl in your story suffered for lack of earnestness
in people. The most difficult are the intellectuals. They talk a lot, but
are not serious.
<!--l. 6592--><p class="noindent" >What you call realisation is a natural thing. When you are ready, your
Guru will be waiting. Sadhana is effortless. When the relationship with
your teacher is right you grow. Above all, trust him. He cannot mislead
you.
<!--l. 6594--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even when he asks me to do something patently wrong?
<!--l. 6596--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Do it. A Sanyasi had been asked by his Guru to marry. He obeyed

and suffered bitterly. But his four children were all saints and
seers, the greatest in Maharashtra. Be happy with whatever
comes from your Guru and you will grow to perfection without
striving.
<!--l. 6598--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, have you any wants or wishes. Can I do anything for
you?
<!--l. 6600--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What can you give me that I do not have? Material things are
needed for contentment. But I am contented with myself. What else do
I need?
<!--l. 6602--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, when you are hungry you need food and when sick you need
medicine.
<!--l. 6604--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Hunger brings the food and illness brings the medicine. It is all
nature&#8217;s work.

<!--l. 6612--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Let him, by all means. Let him spend a fortune, employ hundreds,
feed thousands.
<!--l. 6614--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it not a desire?
<!--l. 6616--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not at all. I am only asking him to do it properly, not stingily,
half-heartedly. He is fulfilling his own desire, not mine. Let him do it
well and be famous among men and gods.
<!--l. 6618--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6628--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6636--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you are in the right state, whatever you see will put you into
samadhi. After all, samadhi is nothing unusual. When the mind is
intensely interested, it becomes one with the object of interest
&#8211;
<!--l. 6638--><p class="noindent" >the seer and the seen become one in seeing, the hearer and the heard
become one in hearing, the lover and the loved become one in loving.
Every experience can be the ground for samadhi.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you always in a state of samadhi?
<!--l. 6642--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course not Samadhi is a state of mind, after all. I am beyond all
experience, even of samadhi. I am the great devourer and destroyer:
whatever I touch dissolves into void ( akash).
<!--l. 6644--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I need samadhis for self-realisation.
<!--l. 6646--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have all the self-realisation you need, but you do not trust it.

Have courage, trust yourself, go, talk, act; give it a chance to
prove itself. With some, realisation comes imperceptibly, but
somehow they need convincing. They have changed, but they do
not notice it. Such non-spectacular cases are often the most
reliable.
<!--l. 6648--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can one believe himself to be realised and be mistaken?
<!--l. 6650--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. The very idea &#8216;I am self-realised&#8217; is a mistake. There is
no &#8216;I am this&#8217;. &#8216;I am that&#8217; in the Natural State.

<!--l. 6654--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Some forty years ago J. Krishnamurti said that there is
life only and all talk of personalities and individualities has no
foundation in reality. He did not attempt to describe life &#8211; he merely
said that while life need not and cannot be described, it can be fully
experienced, if the obstacles to its being experienced are removed. The
main hindrance lies in our idea of, and addiction to, time, in our habit
of anticipating a future in the light of the past. The sum total of the
past becomes the &#8216;I was&#8217;, the hoped for future becomes the &#8216;I shall be&#8217;
and life is a constant effort of crossing over from what &#8216;I was&#8217; to
what &#8216;I shall be&#8217;. The present moment, the. &#8216;now&#8217; is lost sight
of.
<!--l. 6656--><p class="noindent" >Maharaj speaks of &#8216;I am&#8217;. Is it an illusion, like &#8216;I was&#8217; and &#8216;I shall be&#8217;,
or is there something real about it? And if the &#8216;I am&#8217; too is an illusion,
how does one free oneself from it? The very notion of I am free
of &#8216;I am&#8217; is an absurdity. Is there something real, something
lasting about the &#8216;I am&#8217; in distinction from the &#8216;I was&#8217;, or &#8216;I shall
be&#8217;, which change with time, as added memories create new
expectations?
<!--l. 6658--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>The present &#8216;I am&#8217; is as false as the &#8216;I was&#8217; and &#8216;I
shall be&#8217;. It is merely an idea in the mind, an impression left by
memory, and the separate identity it creates is false. this habit of
referring to a false centre must be done away with, the notion
&#8216;I see&#8217;, &#8216;I feel&#8217;, &#8216;I think&#8217;, &#8216;I do&#8217;, must disappear from the field
of consciousness; what remains when the false is no more, is
real.
<!--l. 6660--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is this big talk about elimination of the self? How can the self
eliminate itself? What kind of metaphysical acrobatics can lead to the
disappearance of the acrobat? In the end he will reappear, mightily
proud of his disappearing.

<!--l. 6662--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You need not chase the &#8216;I am&#8217; to kill it. You cannot. All you need is
a sincere longing for reality.
<!--l. 6664--><p class="noindent" >We call it atma-bhakti, the love of the Supreme: or moksha-sankalpa,
the determination to be free from the false. Without love, and will
inspired by love, nothing can be done. Merely talking about Reality
without doing anything about it is self-defeating. There must be love in
the relation between the person who says &#8216;I am&#8217; and the observer of
that &#8216;I am&#8217;. As long as the observer, the inner self, the &#8216;higher&#8217;
self, considers himself apart from the observed, the &#8216;lower&#8217; self,
despises it and condemns it, the situation is hopeless. It is only
when the observer ( vyakta) accepts the person ( vyakti) as a
projection or manifestation of himself, and, so to say, takes the
self into the Self, the duality of &#8216;I&#8217; and &#8216;this&#8217; goes and in the
identity of the outer and the inner the Supreme Reality manifests
itself.
<!--l. 6666--><p class="noindent" >This union of the seer and the seen happens when the seer becomes
conscious of himself as the seer, he is not merely interested in the seen,
which he is anyhow, but also interested in being interested, giving
attention to attention, aware of being aware. Affectionate awareness is
the crucial factor that brings Reality into focus.
<!--l. 6668--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>According to the Theosophists and allied occultists, man consists of
three aspects: personality, individuality and spirituality. Beyond
spirituality lies divinity. The personality is strictly temporary and valid
for one birth only. It begins with the birth of the body and ends with
the birth of the next body.
<!--l. 6670--><p class="noindent" >Once over, it is over for good; nothing remains of it except a few sweet
or bitter lessons.
<!--l. 6672--><p class="noindent" >The individuality begins with the animal-man and ends with the
fully human. The split between the personality and individuality

is characteristic of our present-day humanity. On one side the
individuality with its longing for the true, the good and the beautiful;
on the other side an ugly struggle between habit and ambition, fear and
greed, passivity and violence.
<!--l. 6674--><p class="noindent" >The spirituality aspect is still in abeyance. It cannot manifest itself in
an atmosphere of duality. Only when the personality is reunited with
the individuality and becomes a limited, perhaps, but true expression
of it, that the light and love and beauty of the spiritual come into their
own.
<!--l. 6676--><p class="noindent" >You teach of the vyakti, vyakta, avyakta (observer, observed and
ground of observation). Does it tally with the other view?
<!--l. 6678--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, when the vyakti realises its non-existence in separation from
the vyakta, and the vyakta sees the vyakti as his own expression, then
the peace and silence of the avyakta state come into being. In reality,
the three are one: the vyakta and the avyakta are inseparable, while
the vyakti is the sensing-feeling-thinking process, based on the body
made of and fed by the five elements.
<!--l. 6680--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the relation between the vyakta and the avyakta?
<!--l. 6682--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can there be relation when they are one? All talk of separation
and relation is due to the distorting and corrupting influence of
&#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; idea. The outer self ( vyakti) is merely a projection on
the body-mind of the inner self ( vyakta), which again is only
an expression of the Supreme Self ( avyakta) which is all and
none.
<!--l. 6684--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There are teachers who will not talk of the higher self and lower
self. They address the man as if only the lower self existed. Neither
Buddha nor Christ ever mentioned a higher self. J.

<!--l. 6686--><p class="noindent" >Krishnamurti too fights shy of any mention of the higher self. Why is it
so?
<!--l. 6688--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can there be two selves in one body? The &#8216;I am&#8217; is one. There
is no &#8216;higher I-am&#8217; and &#8216;lower I-am&#8217;. All kinds of states of mind are
presented to awareness and there is self-identification with them. The
objects of observation are not what they appear to be and the
attitudes they are met with are not what they need be. If you think
that Buddha, Christ or Krishnamurti speak to the person, you
are mistaken. They know well that the vyakti, the outer self, is
but a shadow of the vyakta, the inner self, and they address
and admonish the vyakta only. They tell him to give attention
to the outer self, to guide and help it, to feel responsible for
it; in short, to be fully aware of it. Awareness comes from the
Supreme and pervades the inner self; the so-called outer self is only
that part of one&#8217;s being of which one is not aware. One may be
conscious, for every being is conscious, but one is not aware. What is
included in awareness becomes the inner and partakes of the
inner. You may put it differently: the body defines the outer self,
consciousness the inner, and in pure awareness the Supreme is
contacted.
<!--l. 6690--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You said the body defines the outer self. Since you have a body, do
you have also an outer self?
<!--l. 6692--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I would, were I attached to the body and take it to be myself.
<!--l. 6694--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But you are aware of it and attend to its needs.
<!--l. 6696--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The contrary is nearer to truth &#8211; the body knows me and is aware
of my needs. But neither is really so. This body appears in your mind;
in my mind nothing is.
<!--l. 6698--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you mean to say you are quite unconscious of having a

body?
<!--l. 6700--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On the contrary, I am conscious of not having a body.
<!--l. 6702--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I see you smoking!
<!--l. 6704--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Exactly so. You see me smoking. Find out for yourself how did you
come to see me Smoking, and you will easily realise that it is
your &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; state of mind that is responsible for this
&#8216;I-see-you-smoking&#8217; idea.
<!--l. 6706--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is the body and there is myself. I know the body. Apart from
it, what am l?
<!--l. 6708--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no &#8216;I&#8217; apart from the body, nor the world. The three
appear and disappear together. At the root is the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;. Go
beyond it. The idea: &#8216;I-am-not-the-body&#8217; is merely an antidote to the
idea &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; which is false. What is that &#8216;I am&#8217;? Unless you
know yourself, what else can you know?
<!--l. 6710--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>From what you say I conclude that without the body there can be
no liberation. If the idea: &#8216;I-am-not-the-body&#8217; leads to liberation, the
presence of the body is essential.
<!--l. 6712--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite right. Without the body, how can the idea: &#8216;I-am-not-the-body&#8217;
come into being? The idea
<!--l. 6714--><p class="noindent" >&#8216;I-am-free&#8217; is as false as the idea &#8216;I-am-in-bondage&#8217;. Find out the &#8216;I am&#8217;
common to both and go beyond.

<!--l. 6718--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All are mere words, of what use are they to you? You are entangled
in the web of verbal definitions and formulations. Go beyond your

concepts and ideas; in the silence of desire and thought the truth is
found.
<!--l. 6720--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>One has to remember not to remember. What a task!
<!--l. 6722--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It cannot be done, of course. It must happen. But it does happen
when you truly see the need of it. Again, earnestness is the golden
key.
<!--l. 6724--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>At the back of my mind there is a hum going on all the time.
Numerous weak thoughts swarm and buzz and this shapeless cloud is
always with me. Is it the same with you? What is at the back of your
mind?
<!--l. 6726--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Where there is no mind, there is no back to it. I am all front, no
back! The void speaks, the void remains.
<!--l. 6728--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no memory left?
<!--l. 6730--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No memory of past pleasure or pain is left. Each moment is newly
born.
<!--l. 6732--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Without memory you cannot be conscious.
<!--l. 6734--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course I am conscious, and fully aware of it. I am not a block of
wood! Compare consciousness and its content to a cloud. You are inside
the cloud, while I look at. You are lost in it, hardly able to see the tips
of your fingers, while I see the cloud and many other clouds and
the blue sky too and the sun, the moon, the stars. Reality is
one for both of us, but for you it is a prison and for me it is a
home.
<!--l. 6736--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You spoke of the person ( vyakti), the witness ( vyakta) and the
Supreme ( avyakta). Which comes first?

<!--l. 6738--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In the Supreme the witness appears. The witness creates the person
and thinks itself as separate from it. The witness sees that the person
appears in consciousness which again appears in the witness. This
realisation of the basic unity is the working of the Supreme.
It is the power behind the witness, the source from which all
flows. It cannot be contacted, unless there is unity and love and
mutual help between the person and the witness, unless the doing
is in harmony with the being and the knowing. The Supreme
is both the source and the fruit of such harmony. As I talk to
you, I am in the state of detached but affectionate awareness (
turiya). When this awareness turns upon itself, you may call it
the Supreme State, ( turiyatita). But the fundamental reality is
beyond awareness, beyond the three states of becoming, being and
not-being.
<!--l. 6740--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is it that here my mind is engaged in high topics and finds
dwelling on them easy and pleasant. When I return home I find myself
forgetting all l have learnt here, worrying and fretting, unable to
remember my real nature even for a moment. What may be the
cause?
<!--l. 6742--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is your childishness you are returning to. You are not fully grown
up; there are levels left undeveloped because unattended. Just give full
attention to what in you is crude and primitive, unreasonable and
unkind, altogether childish, and you will ripen. It is the maturity of
heart and mind that is essential. It comes effortlessly when the main
obstacle is removed &#8211; inattention, unawareness. In awareness you
grow.

leave everything to him and just live from day to day as righteously

did some meditation.
<!--l. 6756--><p class="noindent" >There was not much of thinking or study; we were just trying to keep

lives.
<!--l. 6758--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Most of the bhaktas trust their Guru only as long as all is well with
them. When troubles come, they feel let down and go out in search of
another Guru.
<!--l. 6760--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, we were warned against this danger. We are trying to take the
hard along with the soft.
<!--l. 6762--><p class="noindent" >The feeling: &#8216;All is Grace&#8217; must be very strong. A sadhu was walking
eastwards, from where a strong wind started blowing. The sadhu
just turned round and walked west. We hope to live just like

that &#8211; adjusting ourselves to circumstances as sent us by our
Guru.
<!--l. 6764--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6766--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>That we understand, yet constantly we make attempts to live our
lives instead of just living.
<!--l. 6768--><p class="noindent" >Making plans for the future seems to be an inveterate habit with
us.
<!--l. 6770--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whether you plan or don&#8217;t, life goes on. But in life itself a little
whorl arises in the mind, which indulges in fantasies and imagines itself
dominating and controlling life. Life itself is desireless. But the
false self wants to continue &#8211; pleasantly. Therefore it is always
engaged in ensuring one&#8217;s continuity. Life is unafraid and free.
As long as you have the idea of influencing events, liberation is
not for you: The very notion of doership, of being a cause, is
bondage.
<!--l. 6772--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can we overcome the duality of the doer and the done?
<!--l. 6774--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Contemplate life as infinite, undivided, ever present, ever
active, until you realise yourself as one with it. It is not even
very difficult, for you will be returning only to your own natural
condition.
<!--l. 6776--><p class="noindent" >Once you realise that all comes from within, that the world in which
you live has not been projected onto you but by you, your fear comes
to an end. Without this realisation you identify yourself with the
externals, like the body, mind, society, nation, humanity, even
God or the Absolute. But these are all escapes from fear. It
is only when you fully accept your responsibility for the little
world in which you live and watch the process of its creation,

preservation and destruction, that you may be free from your
imaginary bondage.
<!--l. 6778--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should I imagine myself so wretched?
<!--l. 6780--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You do it by habit only. Change your ways of feeling and thinking,
take stock of them and examine them closely. You are in bondage by
inadvertence. Attention liberates. You are taking so many things for
granted. Begin to question. The most obvious things are the most
doubtful. Ask yourself such questions as: &#8216;Was I really born?&#8217; &#8216;Am I
really so-and-so?&#8217; &#8216;How do I know that I exist? &#8216;Who are my parents?&#8217;
&#8216;Have they created me, or have I created them?&#8217; &#8216;Must I believe all I
am told about myself?&#8217; &#8216;Who am I, anyhow?&#8217;. You have put so
much energy into building a prison for yourself. Now spend as
much on demolishing it. In fact, demolition is easy, for the false
dissolves when it is discovered. All hangs on the idea &#8216;I am&#8217;.
Examine it very thoroughly. It lies at the root of every trouble. It is
a sort of skin that separates you from the reality. The real is
both within and without the skin, but the skin itself is not real.
This &#8216;I am&#8217; idea was not born with you. You could have lived
very well without it. It came later due to your self-identification
with the body. It created an illusion of separation where there
was none. It made you a stranger in your own world and made
the world alien and inimical. Without the sense of &#8216;I am&#8217; life
goes on. There are moments when we are without the sense of &#8216;I
am&#8217;. at peace and happy. With the return of the &#8216;I am&#8217; trouble
starts.
<!--l. 6783--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is one to be free from the &#8216;I&#8217;-sense?
<!--l. 6785--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You must deal with the &#8216;I&#8217;-sense if you want to be free of it. Watch
it in operation and at peace, how it starts and when it ceases, what it
wants and how it gets it, till you see clearly and understand fully.
After all, all the Yogas, whatever their source and character,

have only one aim: to save you from the calamity of separate
existence, of being a meaningless dot in a vast and beautiful
picture.
<!--l. 6787--><p class="noindent" >You suffer because you have alienated yourself from reality and now
you seek an escape from this alienation. You cannot escape from your
own obsessions. You can only cease nursing them.
<!--l. 6789--><p class="noindent" >It is because the &#8216;I am&#8217; is false that it wants to continue. Reality need
not continue &#8211; knowing itself indestructible, it is indifferent to the
destruction of forms and expressions. To strengthen, and stabilise the &#8216;I
am&#8217; we do all sorts of things &#8211; all in vain, for the &#8216;I am&#8217; is being
rebuilt from moment to moment. It is unceasing work and the
only radical solution is to dissolve the separative sense of &#8216;I am
such-and-such person&#8217; once and for good. Being remains, but not
self-being.
<!--l. 6791--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have definite spiritual ambitions. Must I not work for their
fulfilment?
<!--l. 6793--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No ambition is spiritual. All ambitions are for the sake of
the &#8216;I am&#8217;. If you want to make real progress you must give up
all idea of personal attainment. The ambitions of the so-called
Yogis are preposterous. A man&#8217;s desire for a woman is innocence
itself compared to the lusting for an everlasting personal bliss.
The mind is a cheat. The more pious it seems, the worse the
betrayal.
<!--l. 6795--><p class="noindent" ><span

for help. How do you know what to tell them?
<!--l. 6797--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I just tell them what comes to my mind at the moment. I have no
standardised procedure in dealing with people.

<!--l. 6799--><p class="noindent" ><span

how am I to be sure that my advice is right?
<!--l. 6801--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Watch in what state you are, from what level you talk. If you talk
from the mind, you may be wrong. If you talk from full insight
into the situation, with your own mental habits in abeyance
your advice may be a true response. The main point is to be
fully aware that neither you nor the man in front of you are
mere bodies; If your awareness is clear and full. a mistake is less
probable.

engaged in social work for poor women. Our son is leaving for the
United States and we came to see him off. We are Panjabis but we

We have met many holy people and we are glad to meet one
more.
<!--l. 6807--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You have met many anchorites and ascetics, but a fully
realised man conscious of his divinity ( swarupa) is hard to find. The
saints and Yogis, by immense efforts and sacrifices, acquire many
miraculous powers and can do much good in the way of helping people
and inspiring faith, yet it does not make them perfect. It is not a way
to reality, but merely an enrichment of the false. All effort leads to
more effort; whatever was built up must be maintained, whatever was
acquired must be protected against decay or loss. Whatever can be lost
is not really one&#8217;s own; and what is not your own of what use can it be
to you? In my world nothing is pushed about, all happens by
itself.
<!--l. 6809--><p class="noindent" >All existence is in space and time, limited and temporary. He who
experiences existence is also limited and temporary. I am not concerned
either with &#8216;what exists&#8217; or with &#8216;who exists&#8217;. I take my stand beyond,
where I am both and neither.
<!--l. 6811--><p class="noindent" >The persons who, after much effort and penance, have fulfilled their
ambitions and secured higher levels of experience and action, are
usually acutely conscious of their standing; they grade people into
hierarchies, ranging from the lowest non-achiever to the highest
achiever. To me all are equal.
<!--l. 6813--><p class="noindent" >Differences in appearance and expression are there, but they do not

matter. Just as the shape of a gold ornament does not affect
the gold, so does man&#8217;s essence remain unaffected. Where this
sense of equality is lacking it means that reality had not been
touched.
<!--l. 6815--><p class="noindent" >Mere knowledge is not enough; the knower must be known. The
Pandits and the Yogis may know many things, but of what use is
mere knowledge when the self is not known? It will be certainly

<!--l. 6819--><p class="noindent" ><span

When I met my Guru, he told me: &#8216;You are not what you take
yourself to be. Find out what you are. Watch the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;, find
your real self&#8217;. I obeyed him, because I trusted him. I did as he
told me. All my spare time I would spend looking at myself in
silence. And what a difference it made, and how soon! It took
me only three years to realise my true nature. My Guru died
soon after I met him, but it made no difference. I remembered
what he told me and persevered. The fruit of it is here, with

<!--l. 6831--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because it cannot be told. You must gain your own experience. You
are accustomed to deal with things, physical and mental. I am not a

difficult to understand.
<!--l. 6833--><p class="noindent" >We believe in so many things on hearsay. We believe in distant lands
and people, in heavens and hells, in gods and goddesses, because we
were told. Similarly, we were told about ourselves, our parents, name,
position, duties and so on. We never cared to verify. The way to truth
lies through the destruction of the false. To destroy the false, you must
question your most inveterate beliefs. Of these the idea that you are
the body is the worst. With the body comes the world, with the world

<!--l. 6835--><p class="noindent" >God, who is supposed to have created the world and thus it
starts &#8211; fears, religions, prayers, sacrifices, all sorts of systems
&#8211; all to protect and support the child-man, frightened out of

are cannot be born nor die and with the fear gone all suffering
ends.
<!--l. 6837--><p class="noindent" >What the mind invents, the mind destroys. But the real is not invented
and cannot be destroyed.
<!--l. 6839--><p class="noindent" >Hold on to that over which the mind has no power. What I am telling
you about is neither in the past nor in the future. Nor is it in the daily
life as it flows in the now. It is timeless and the total timelessness of it
is beyond the mind. My Guru and his words: &#8216;You are myself&#8217; are
timelessly with me. In the beginning I had to fix my mind on them, but
now it has become natural and easy. The point when the mind accepts
the words of the Guru as true and lives by them spontaneously and

in every detail of daily life is the threshold of realisation. In a
way it is salvation by faith, but the faith must be intense and
lasting.
<!--l. 6841--><p class="noindent" >However, you must not think that faith itself is enough. Faith expressed
in action is a sure means to realisation. Of all the means it is the most
effective. There are teachers who deny faith and trust reason only.
Actually it is not faith they deny, but blind beliefs. Faith is not blind.
It is the willingness to try.
<!--l. 6843--><p class="noindent" ><span

the attitude of a mere witness is the most efficacious. How does it
compare with faith?
<!--l. 6845--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The witness attitude is also faith; it is faith in oneself. You believe
that you are not what you experience and you look at everything as
from a distance. There is no effort in witnessing. You understand that
you are the witness only and the understanding acts. You need
nothing more, just remember that you are the witness only. If
in the state of witnessing you ask yourself: &#8216;Who am I?&#8217;, the
answer comes at once, though it is wordless and silent. Cease
to be the object and become the subject of all that happens;
once having turned within, you will find yourself beyond the
subject.
<!--l. 6847--><p class="noindent" >When you have found yourself, you will find that you are also beyond
the object, that both the subject and the object exist in you, but you
are neither.
<!--l. 6849--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You speak of the mind, of the witnessing consciousness beyond the
mind and of the Supreme, which is beyond awareness. Do you mean to
say that even awareness is not real?
<!--l. 6851--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you deal in terms: real &#8211; unreal; awareness is the only

reality that can be. But the Supreme is beyond all distinctions and to it
the term &#8216;real&#8217; does not apply, for in it all is real and, therefore, need
not be labelled as such. It is the very source of reality, it imparts reality
to whatever it touches. It just cannot be understood through words.
Even a direct experience, however sublime, merely bears testimony,
nothing more.

The Supreme ( paramakash) imparts reality to whatever comes into

all created things respond to each other, that bring people together, if
not from the Supreme? Shun not desire; see only that it flows into the
right channels. Without desire you are dead. But with low desires you
are a ghost.
<!--l. 6861--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the experience which comes nearest to the Supreme?
<!--l. 6863--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Immense peace and boundless love. realise that whatever there is
true, noble and beautiful in the universe, it all comes from you, that
you yourself are at the source of it. The gods and goddesses that
supervise the world may be most wonderful and glorious beings; yet
they are like the gorgeously dressed servants who proclaim the power
and the riches of their master.
<!--l. 6865--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one reach the Supreme State?

<!--l. 6867--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By renouncing all lesser desires. As long as you are pleased
with the lesser, you cannot have the highest. Whatever pleases
you, keeps you back. Until you realise the unsatisfactoriness of
everything, its transiency and limitation, and collect your energies in
one great longing, even the first step is not made. On the other
hand, the integrity of the desire for the Supreme is by itself a call
from the Supreme. Nothing, physical or mental, can give you
freedom. You are free once you understand that your bondage is of
your own making and you cease forging the chains that bind
you.
<!--l. 6869--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one find the faith in a Guru?
<!--l. 6871--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To find the Guru and also the trust in him is rare luck. It does not
happen often.
<!--l. 6873--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it destiny that ordains?
<!--l. 6875--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Calling it destiny explains little. When it happens you cannot say
why it happens and you merely cover up your ignorance by calling it
karma or Grace, or the Will of God.
<!--l. 6877--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Krishnamurti says that Guru is not needed.
<!--l. 6879--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Somebody must tell you about the Supreme Reality and the way
that leads to it. Krishnamurti is doing nothing else. In a way he is right
&#8211; most of the so-called disciples do not trust their Gurus; they disobey
them and finally abandon them. For such disciples it would have been
infinitely better if they had no Guru at all and just looked within for
guidance. to find a living Guru is a rare opportunity and a great
responsibility. One should not treat these matters lightly. You
people are out to buy yourself the heaven and you imagine that
the Guru will supply it for a price. You seek to strike a bargain
by offering little but asking much. You cheat nobody except

yourselves.
<!--l. 6881--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You were told by your Guru that you are the Supreme and you
trusted him and acted on it.
<!--l. 6883--><p class="noindent" >What gave you this trust?
<!--l. 6885--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Say, I was just reasonable. It would have been foolish to
distrust him. What interest could he possibly have in misleading
me?
<!--l. 6887--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You told a questioner that we are the same, that we are equals. I
cannot believe it. Since I do not believe it, of what use is your
statement to me?
<!--l. 6889--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your disbelief does not matter. My words are true and they will do
their work. This is the beauty of noble company ( satsang).
<!--l. 6891--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Just sitting near you can it be considered spiritual practice?
<!--l. 6893--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. The river of life is flowing. Some of its water is here, but
so much of it has already reached its goal. You know only the present. I
see much further into the past and future, into what you are and what
you can be. I cannot but see you as myself. It is in the very nature of
love to see no difference.
<!--l. 6895--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I come to see myself as you see me?
<!--l. 6897--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is enough if you do not imagine yourself to be the body. It is the
&#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; idea that is so calamitous. It blinds you completely to
your real nature. Even for a moment do not think that you are the
body. Give yourself no name, no shape. In the darkness and the silence
reality is found.

<!--l. 6899--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must not I think with some conviction that I am not the body?
Where am I to find such conviction?
<!--l. 6901--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Behave as if you were fully convinced and the confidence will come.
What is the use of mere words? A formula, a mental pattern will
not help you. But unselfish action, free from all concern with
the body and its interests will carry you into the very heart of
Reality.
<!--l. 6903--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Where am I to get the courage to act without conviction?
<!--l. 6905--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Love will give you the courage. When you meet somebody wholly
admirable, love-worthy, sublime, your love and admiration will give you
the urge to act nobly.
<!--l. 6907--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Not everybody knows to admire the admirable. Most of the people
are totally insensitive.
<!--l. 6909--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Life will make them appreciate. The very weight of accumulated
experience will give them eyes to see. When you meet a worthy man,
you will love and trust him and follow his advice. This is the role of the
realised people &#8211; to set an example of perfection for others to admire
and love. Beauty of life and character is a tremendous contribution to
the common good.
<!--l. 6911--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must we not suffer to grow?
<!--l. 6913--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is enough to know that there is suffering, that the world suffers.
By themselves neither pleasure nor pain enlighten. Only understanding
does. Once you have grasped the truth that the world is full of
suffering, that to be born is a calamity, you will find the urge and the
energy to go beyond it. Pleasure puts you to sleep and pain
wakes you up. If you do not want to suffer, don&#8217;t go to sleep. You
cannot know yourself through bliss alone, for bliss is your very

nature. You must face the opposite, what you are not, to find
enlightenment.

<!--l. 6939--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6941--><p class="noindent" >There must be something continuous to register discontinuity.
<!--l. 6943--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The mind remembers. This stands for continuity.
<!--l. 6945--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Memory is always partial, unreliable and evanescent. It does not

<!--l. 6947--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>However deeply I look, I find only the mind. Your words &#8216;beyond
the mind&#8217; give me no clue.
<!--l. 6949--><p class="noindent" ><span

beyond, you must look away from the mind and its contents.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In what direction am I to look?
<!--l. 6953--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All directions are within the mind! I am not asking you to look in
any particular direction. Just look away from all that happens in your
mind and bring it to the feeling &#8216;I am&#8217;. The &#8216;I am&#8217; is not a direction. It
is the negation of all direction. Ultimately even the &#8216;I am&#8217; will have to
go, for you need not keep on asserting what is obvious. Bringing the
mind to the feeling &#8216;I am&#8217; merely helps in turning the mind away from
everything else.
<!--l. 6955--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Where does it all lead me?
<!--l. 6957--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When the mind is kept away from its preoccupations, it
becomes quiet. If you do not disturb this quiet and stay in it, you
find that it is permeated with a light and a love you have never
known; and yet you recognise it at once as your own nature.
Once you have passed through this experience, you will never be
the same man again; the unruly mind may break its peace and
obliterate its vision; but it is bound to return, provided the effort is
sustained; until the day when all bonds are broken, delusions and
attachments end and life becomes supremely concentrated in the
present.
<!--l. 6959--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What difference does it make?

<!--l. 6961--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind is no more. There is only love in action.

<!--l. 6965--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 6967--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surrounded by a world full of mysteries and dangers, how can I
remain unafraid?
<!--l. 6969--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your own little body too is full of mysteries and dangers,
yet you are not afraid of it, for you take it as your own. What
you do not know is that the entire universe is your body and
you need not be afraid of it. You may say you have two bodies;
the personal and the universal. The personal comes and goes,
the universal is always with you. The entire creation is your
universal body. You are so blinded by what is personal, that you
do not see the universal. This blindness will not end by itself
&#8211;
<!--l. 6971--><p class="noindent" >it must be undone skilfully and deliberately. When all illusions are
understood and abandoned, you reach the error-free and perfect state
in which all distinctions between the personal and the universal are no
more.
<!--l. 6973--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am a person and therefore limited in space and time. I occupy
little space and last but a few moments; I cannot even conceive myself
to be eternal and all-pervading.
<!--l. 6975--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nevertheless you are. As you dive deep into yourself in search of
your true nature, you will discover that only your body is small
and only your memory is short; while the vast ocean of life is
yours.
<!--l. 6977--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The very words &#8216;I&#8217; and &#8216;universal&#8217; are contradictory. One excludes

the other.
<!--l. 6979--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They don&#8217;t. The sense of identity pervades the universal. Search
and you shall discover the Universal Person, who is yourself and
infinitely more.
<!--l. 6981--><p class="noindent" >Anyhow, begin by realising that the world is in you, not you in the
world.
<!--l. 6983--><p class="noindent" ><span

whole world be contained in the part, except by reflection, mirror
like?
<!--l. 6985--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What you say is true. Your personal body is a part in which the
whole is wonderfully reflected.
<!--l. 6987--><p class="noindent" >But you have also a universal body. You cannot even say that you do
not know it, because you see and experience it all the time. Only you
call it &#8216;the world&#8217; and are afraid of it.
<!--l. 6989--><p class="noindent" ><span

through science.
<!--l. 6991--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your little body is full of mysteries and wonders which you do not
know. There also science is your only guide. Both anatomy and
astronomy describe you.
<!--l. 6993--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even If I accept your doctrine of the universal body as a
working theory, in what way can I test it and of what use is it to
me?
<!--l. 6995--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Knowing yourself as the dweller in both the bodies you will disown
nothing. All the universe will be your concern; every living thing you
will love and help most tenderly and wisely. There will be no clash of

interests between you and others. All exploitation will cease absolutely.
Your every action will be beneficial, every movement will be a
blessing.
<!--l. 6997--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is all very tempting, but how am I to proceed to realise my
universal being?
<!--l. 6999--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have two ways: you can give your heart and mind to
self-discovery, or you accept my words on trust and act accordingly. In
other words, either you become totally self-concerned, or totally
un-self-concerned. It is the word &#8216;totally&#8217; that is important. You must
be extreme to reach the Supreme.
<!--l. 7001--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I aspire to such heights, small and limited as I am?
<!--l. 7003--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>realise yourself as the ocean of consciousness in which all
happens. This is not difficult. A little of attentiveness, of close
observation of oneself, and you will see that no event is outside your
consciousness.
<!--l. 7005--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The world is full of events which do not appear in my consciousness.
<!--l. 7007--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Even your body is full of events which do not appear in your
consciousness. This does not prevent you from claiming your body to
be your own. You know the world exactly as you know your body
&#8211; through your senses. It is your mind that has separated the
world outside your skin from the world inside and put them in
opposition. This created fear and hatred and all the miseries of
living.
<!--l. 7009--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What I do not follow is what you say about going beyond
consciousness. I understand the words, but I cannot visualise the
experience. After all, you yourself have said that all experience is in
consciousness.

<!--l. 7011--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are right, there can be no experience beyond consciousness.
Yet there is the experience of just being. There is a state beyond
consciousness, which is not unconscious. Some call it super-consciousness,
or pure consciousness, or supreme consciousness. It is pure awareness
free from the subject object nexus.
<!--l. 7013--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have studied Theosophy and I find nothing familiar in what
you say. I admit Theosophy deals with manifestation only. It
describes the universe and its inhabitants in great details. It admits
many levels of matter and corresponding levels of experience, but
it does not seem to go beyond. What you say goes beyond all
experience. If it is not experienceable, why at all talk about
it?
<!--l. 7015--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness is intermittent, full of gaps. Yet there is the
continuity of identity. What is this sense of identity due to, if not to
something beyond consciousness?
<!--l. 7017--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I am beyond the mind, how can I change myself?
<!--l. 7019--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Where is the need of changing anything? The mind is changing
anyhow all the time. Look at your mind dispassionately; this is enough
to calm it. When it is quiet, you can go beyond it. Do not keep it busy
all the time. Stop it &#8211; and just be. If you give it rest, it will settle down
and recover its purity and strength. Constant thinking makes it
decay.
<!--l. 7021--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If my true being is always with me, how is it that I am ignorant of
it?
<!--l. 7023--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because it is very subtle and your mind is gross, full of gross
thoughts and feelings. Calm and clarify your mind and you will know
yourself as you are.

<!--l. 7025--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do I need the mind to know myself?
<!--l. 7027--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are beyond the mind, but you know with your mind. It is
obvious that the extent, depth and character of knowledge depend on
what instrument you use. Improve your instrument and your knowledge
will improve.
<!--l. 7029--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To know perfectly I need a perfect mind.
<!--l. 7031--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A quiet mind is all you need. All else will happen rightly, once your
mind is quiet. As the sun on rising makes the world active, so does
self-awareness affect changes in the mind. In the light of calm and
steady self-awareness inner energies wake up and work miracles without
any effort on your part.
<!--l. 7033--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You mean to say that the greatest work is done by not working?
<!--l. 7035--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Exactly. Do understand that you are destined for enlightenment.
Co-operate with your destiny, don&#8217;t go against it, don&#8217;t thwart it.
Allow it to fulfil itself. All you have to do is to give attention to the
obstacles created by the foolish mind.

you are is natural, to know what you are is the result of much
investigation. You will have to explore the entire field of consciousness
and go beyond it. For this you must find the right teacher and
create the conditions needed for discovery. Generally speaking,
there are two ways: external and internal. Either you live with
somebody who knows the Truth and submit yourself entirely
to his guiding and moulding influence, or you seek the inner
guide and follow the inner light wherever it takes you. In both
cases your personal desires and fears must be disregarded. You
learn either by proximity or by investigation, the passive or the
active way. You either let yourself be carried by the river of
life and love represented by your Guru, or you make your own
efforts, guided by your inner star. In both cases you must move
on, you must be earnest. Rare are the people who are lucky to

find somebody worthy of trust and love. Most of them must
take the hard way, the way of intelligence and understanding, of
discrimination and detachment ( viveka-vairagya). This is the way open

radical transformation.

<!--l. 7055--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 7057--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the source of earnestness?
<!--l. 7059--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is the homing instinct, which makes the bird return to its nest
and the fish to the mountain stream where it was born. The
seed returns to the earth, when the fruit is ripe. Ripeness is
all.
<!--l. 7061--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what will ripen me? Do I need experience?
<!--l. 7063--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You already have all the experience you need, otherwise you would
not have come here. You need not gather any more, rather you must go
beyond experience. Whatever effort you make, whatever method (
sadhana) you follow, will merely generate more experience, but will not
take you beyond. Nor will reading books help you. They will enrich

your mind, but the person you are will remain intact. If you expect any
benefits from your search, material, mental or spiritual, you have
missed the point. Truth gives no advantage. It gives you no higher
status, no power over others; all you get is truth and the freedom from
the false.
<!--l. 7065--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely truth gives you the power to help others.
<!--l. 7067--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This is mere imagination, however noble! In truth you do not help
others, because there are no others. You divide people into noble and
ignoble and you ask the noble to help the ignoble. You separate, you
evaluate, you judge and condemn &#8211; in the name of truth you
destroy it. Your very desire to formulate truth denies it, because it
cannot be contained in words. Truth can be expressed only by
the denial of the false &#8211; in action. For this you must see the
false as false ( viveka) and reject it ( vairagya). Renunciation of
the false is liberating and energizing. It lays open the road to
perfection.
<!--l. 7069--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When do I know that I have discovered truth?
<!--l. 7071--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When the idea &#8216;this is true&#8217;, &#8216;that is true&#8217; does not arise. Truth
does not assert itself, it is in the seeing of the false as false and
rejecting it. It is useless to search for truth, when the mind is blind to
the false. It must be purged of the false completely before truth can

<!--l. 7075--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Surely, what has no being is false.
<!--l. 7077--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What do you mean by having no being? The false is there, hard as a
nail.

<!--l. 7079--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What contradicts itself, has no being. Or it has only momentary
being, which comes to the same. For, what has a beginning and
an end has no middle. It is hollow. It has only the name and
shape given to it by the mind, but it has neither substance nor
essence.
<!--l. 7081--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If all that passes has no being, then the universe has no being
either.
<!--l. 7083--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who ever denies it? Of course the universe has no being.
<!--l. 7085--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What has?
<!--l. 7087--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That which does not depend for its existence, which does not arise
with the universe arising, nor set with the universe setting, which
does not need any proof, but imparts reality to all it touches.
It is the nature of the false that it appears real for a moment.
One could say that the true becomes the father of the false.
But the false is limited in time and space and is produced by
circumstances.
<!--l. 7089--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to get rid of the false and secure the real?
<!--l. 7091--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To what purpose?
<!--l. 7093--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In order to live a better, a more satisfactory life, integrated and
happy.
<!--l. 7095--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whatever is conceived by the mind must be false, for it is
bound to be relative and limited. The real is inconceivable and
cannot be harnessed to a purpose. It must be wanted for its own
sake.
<!--l. 7097--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I want the inconceivable?

<!--l. 7099--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else is there worth wanting? Granted, the real cannot be
wanted, as a thing is wanted. But you can see the unreal as unreal and
discard it. It is the discarding the false that opens the way to the
true.
<!--l. 7101--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I understand, but how does it look in actual daily life?
<!--l. 7103--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Self-interest and self-concern are the focal points of the false. Your
daily life vibrates between desire and fear. Watch it intently
and you will see how the mind assumes innumerable names and
shapes, like a river foaming between the boulders. Trace every
action to its selfish motive and look at the motive intently till it
dissolves.
<!--l. 7105--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To live, one must look after oneself, one must earn money for
oneself.
<!--l. 7107--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You need not earn for yourself, but you may have to &#8211; for a woman
and a child. You may have to keep on working for the sake of
others. Even just to keep alive can be a sacrifice. There is no need
whatsoever to be selfish. Discard every self-seeking motive as soon
as it is seen and you need not search for truth; truth will find
you.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But one must survive!
<!--l. 7115--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can&#8217;t help surviving! The real you is timeless and beyond birth
and death. And the body will survive as long as it is needed. It is not

important that it should live long. A full life is better than a long
life.
<!--l. 7117--><p class="noindent" ><span

background.
<!--l. 7119--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you seek reality you must set yourself free of all backgrounds, of
all cultures, of all patterns of thinking and feeling. Even the idea of
being man or woman, or even human, should be discarded.
<!--l. 7121--><p class="noindent" >The ocean of life contains all, not only humans. So, first of all abandon
all self-identification, stop thinking of yourself as such-and-such,
so-and-so, this or that. Abandon all self-concern, worry not about your
welfare, material or spiritual, abandon every desire, gross or subtle,
stop thinking of achievement of any kind. You are complete here and
now, you need absolutely nothing.
<!--l. 7123--><p class="noindent" >It does not mean that you must be brainless and foolhardy, improvident
or indifferent; only the basic anxiety for oneself must go. You
need some food, clothing and shelter for you and yours, but
this will not create problems as long as greed is not taken for a
need. Live in tune with things as they are and not as they are
imagined.
<!--l. 7125--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What am I if not human?
<!--l. 7127--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That which makes you think that you are a human is not
human. It is but a dimensionless point of consciousness, a conscious
nothing; all you can say about yourself is: &#8216;I am.&#8217; You are pure
being
<!--l. 7129--><p class="noindent" >&#8211; awareness &#8211; bliss. To realise that is the end of all seeking. You come
to it when you see all you think yourself to be as mere imagination
and stand aloof in pure awareness of the transient as transient,

imaginary as imaginary, unreal as unreal. It is not at all difficult,
but detachment is needed. It is the clinging to the false that
makes the true so difficult to see. Once you understand that the
false needs time and what needs time is false, you are nearer the
Reality, which is timeless, ever in the now. Eternity in time is mere
repetitiveness, like the movement of a clock. It flows from the
past into the future endlessly, an empty perpetuity. Reality is
what makes the present so vital, so different from the past and
future, which are merely mental. If you need time to achieve
something, it must be false. The real is always with you; you need not
wait to be what you are. Only you must not allow your mind to
go out of yourself in search. When you want something, ask
yourself: do I really need it? and if the answer is no, then just drop
it.
<!--l. 7131--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must I not be happy? I may not need a thing, yet if it can make me
happy, should I not grasp it?
<!--l. 7133--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing can make you happier than you are. All search for
happiness is misery and leads to more misery. The only happiness
worth the name is the natural happiness of conscious being.
<!--l. 7135--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Don&#8217;t I need a lot of experience before I can reach such a high level
of awareness?
<!--l. 7137--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Experience leaves only memories behind and adds to the
burden which is heavy enough. You need no more experiences. The
past ones are sufficient. And if you feel you need more, look
into the hearts of people around you. You will find a variety of
experiences which you would not be able to go through in a
thousand years. Learn from the sorrows of others and save yourself
your own. It is not experience that you need, but the freedom
from all experience. Don&#8217;t be greedy for experience; you need
none.

<!--l. 7139--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Don&#8217;t you pass through experiences yourself?
<!--l. 7141--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Things happen round me, but I take no part in them. An event
becomes an experience only when I am emotionally involved. I am in a
state which is complete, which seeks not to improve on itself. Of what
use is experience to me?
<!--l. 7143--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>One needs knowledge, education.
<!--l. 7145--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To deal with things knowledge of things is needed. To deal with
people, you need insight, sympathy. To deal with yourself you need
nothing. Be what you are: conscious being and don&#8217;t stray away from
yourself.
<!--l. 7147--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>University education is most useful.
<!--l. 7149--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No doubt, It helps you to earn a living. But it does not teach you
how to live. You are a student of psychology. It may help you in certain
situations. But can you live by psychology? Life is worthy of the name
only when it reflects Reality in action. No university will teach you how
to live so that when the time of dying comes, you can say: I lived well
I do not need to live again. Most of us die wishing we could
live again. So many mistakes committed, so much left undone.
Most of the people vegetate, but do not live. They merely gather
experience and enrich their memory. But experience is the denial
of Reality, which is neither sensory nor conceptual, neither of
the body, nor of the mind, though it includes and transcends
both.
<!--l. 7151--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But experience is most useful. By experience you learn not to touch
a flame.
<!--l. 7153--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I have told you already that knowledge is most useful in
dealing with things. But it does not tell you how to deal with

people and yourself, how to live a life. We are not talking. of
driving a car, or earning money. For this you need experience.
But for being a light unto yourself material knowledge will not
help you. You need something much more intimate and deeper
than mediate knowledge, to be your self in the true sense of
the word. Your outer life is unimportant. You can become a
night watchman and live happily. It is what you are inwardly
that matters. Your inner peace and joy you have to earn. It is
much more difficult than earning money. No university can teach
you to be yourself. The only way to learn is by practice. Right
away begin to be yourself. Discard all you are not and go ever
deeper. Just as a man digging a well discards what is not water,
until he reaches the water-bearing strata, so must you discard
what is not your own, till nothing is left which you can disown.
You will find that what is left is nothing which the mind can
hook on to. You are not even a human being. You just are &#8211; a
point of awareness, co-extensive with time and space and beyond
both, the ultimate cause, itself uncaused. If you ask me: &#8216;Who
are you?&#8217; My answer would be: &#8216;Nothing in particular. Yet, I
am.&#8217;
<!--l. 7156--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If you are nothing in particular, then you must be the universal.
<!--l. 7158--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is to be universal &#8211; not as a concept, but as a way of life?
Not to separate, not to oppose, but to understand and love whatever
contacts you, is living universally. To be able to say truly: I am the
world., the world is me, I am at home in the world, the world is my
own. Every existence is my existence, every consciousness is my
consciousness, every sorrow is my sorrow and every joy is my joy &#8211; this
is universal life. Yet, my real being, and yours too, is beyond the
universe and, therefore, beyond the categories of the particular
and the universal. It is what it is, totally self-contained and
independent.

<!--l. 7160--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find it hard to understand.
<!--l. 7162--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You must give yourself time to brood over these things. The old
grooves must be erased in your brain, without forming new ones. You
must realise yourself as the immovable, behind and beyond the
movable, the silent witness of all that happens.
<!--l. 7164--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it mean that I must give up all idea of an active life?
<!--l. 7166--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not at all. There will be marriage, there will be children, there will
be earning money to maintain a family; all this will happen in the
natural course of events, for destiny must fulfil itself; you will go
through it without resistance, facing tasks as they come, attentive and
thorough, both in small things and big. But the general attitude will be
of affectionate detachment, enormous goodwill, without expectation of
return, constant giving without asking. In marriage you are neither the
husband nor the wife; you are the love between the two. You
are the clarity and kindness that makes everything orderly and
happy. It may seem vague to you, but if you think a little, you
will find that the mystical is most practical, for it makes your
life creatively happy. Your consciousness is raised to a higher
dimension, from which you see everything much clearer and with
greater intensity. You realise that the person you became at birth
and will cease to be at death is temporary and false. You are
not the sensual, emotional and intellectual person, gripped by
desires and fears. Find out your real being. What am l? is the
fundamental question of all philosophy and psychology. Go into it
deeply.

<!--l. 7170--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>The seeker is he who is in search of himself. Soon he
discovers that his own body he cannot be. Once the conviction: &#8216;I am
not the body&#8217; becomes so well grounded that he can no longer feel,
think and act for and on behalf of the body, he will easily discover that
he is the universal being, knowing, acting, that in him and through him
the entire universe is real, conscious and active. This is the heart of the
problem. Either you are body-conscious and a slave of circumstances,
or you are the universal consciousness itself &#8211; and in full control of
every event.
<!--l. 7172--><p class="noindent" >Yet consciousness, individual or universal, is not my true abode; I am
not in it, it is not mine, there is no &#8216;me&#8217; in it. I am beyond, though it is
not easy to explain how one can be neither conscious, nor unconscious,
but just beyond. I cannot say that I am in God or I am God; God is
the universal light and love, the universal witness: I am beyond the
universal even.
<!--l. 7174--><p class="noindent" ><span

of being have you?

<!--l. 7186--><p class="noindent" ><span

me to emptiness!
<!--l. 7188--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If you are beyond words, what shall we talk about? Metaphysically
speaking, what you say holds together; there is no inner contradiction.
But there is no food for me in what you say. It is so completely beyond
my urgent needs. When I ask for bread, you are giving jewels. They are
beautiful, no doubt, but I am hungry.
<!--l. 7190--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not so. I am offering you exactly what you need &#8211; awakening.
You are not hungry and you need no bread. You need cessation,
relinquishing, disentanglement. What you believe you need is not what
you need. Your real need I know, not you. You need to return to the
state in which I am &#8211;
<!--l. 7192--><p class="noindent" >your natural state. Anything else you may think of is an illusion and an
obstacle. Believe me, you need nothing except to be what you are. You
imagine you will increase your value by acquisition. It is like gold
imagining that an addition of copper will improve it. Elimination and
purification, renunciation of all that is foreign to your nature is enough.
All else is vanity.
<!--l. 7194--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 7198--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is the mind that tells you that the mind is there. Don&#8217;t be
deceived. All the endless arguments about the mind are produced by
the mind itself, for its own protection, continuation and expansion. It is
the blank refusal to consider the convolutions and convulsions of the
mind that can take you beyond it.

<!--l. 7200--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, I am an humble seeker, while you are the Supreme Reality

enlightened. What does the Supreme do?
<!--l. 7202--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Listen to what I keep on telling you and do not move away from it.
Think of it all the time and of nothing else. Having reached that far,
abandon all thoughts, not only of the world, but of yourself also.
Stay beyond all thoughts, in silent being-awareness. It is not
progress, for what you come to is already there in you, waiting for
you.

<!--l. 7208--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I happen to meet many young people coming from the West and I
find that there is a basic difference when I compare them to the
Indians. It looks as if their psyche ( antahkarana) is different.
<!--l. 7210--><p class="noindent" >Concepts like Self, Reality, pure mind, universal consciousness the
Indian mind grasps easily. They ring familiar, they taste sweet. The
Western mind does not respond, or just rejects them. It concretises and
wants to utilise at once in the service of accepted values. These values
are often personal: health, well-being, prosperity; sometimes they are
social &#8211; a better society, a happier life for all; all are connected with
worldly problems, personal or impersonal. Another difficulty one comes
across quite often in talking with the Westerners is that to them
everything is experience &#8211;
<!--l. 7212--><p class="noindent" >as they want to experience food, drink and women, art and travels, so
do they want to experience Yoga, realisation and liberation. To them it
is just another experience, to be had for a price. They imagine such

experience can be purchased and they bargain about the cost. When
one Guru quotes too high, in terms of time and effort, they go
to another, who offers instalment terms, apparently very easy,
but beset with unfulfillable conditions. It is the old story of not
thinking of the grey monkey when taking the medicine! In this
case it is not thinking of the world, &#8216;abandoning all self-hood&#8217;,
&#8216;extinguishing every desire&#8217;, &#8216;becoming perfect celibates&#8217; etc.
Naturally there is vast cheating going on all levels and the results are
nil. Some Gurus in sheer desperation abandon all discipline,
prescribe no conditions, advise effortlessness, naturalness, simply
living in passive awareness, without any pattern of &#8216;must&#8217; and
&#8216;must not&#8217; And there are many disciples whose past experiences
brought them to dislike themselves so badly that they just do not
want to look at themselves. If they are not disgusted, they are
bored. They have surfeit of self-knowledge, they want something
else.
<!--l. 7214--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Let them not think of themselves, if they do not like it. Let them
stay with a Guru, watch him, think of him. Soon they will experience a
kind of bliss, quite new, never experienced before, except, maybe, in
childhood. The experience is so unmistakably new, that it will attract
their attention and create interest; once the interest is roused, orderly
application will follow.
<!--l. 7216--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>These people are very critical and suspicious. They cannot
be otherwise, having passed through much learning and much
disappointment. On one hand they want experience, on the other they
mistrust it. How to reach them, God alone knows!
<!--l. 7218--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>True insight and love will reach them.
<!--l. 7220--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When they have some spiritual experience, another difficulty arises.
They complain that the experience does not last, that it comes and
goes in a haphazard way. Having got hold of the lollipop, they want to

suck it all the time.
<!--l. 7222--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Experience, however sublime, is not the real thing. By its very
nature it comes and goes. Self-realisation is not an acquisition. It is
more of the nature of understanding. Once arrived at, it cannot be lost.
On the other hand, consciousness is changeful, flowing, undergoing
transformation from moment to moment. Do not hold on to
consciousness and its contents. Consciousness held, ceases. To try to
perpetuate a flash of insight, or a burst of happiness is destructive of
what it wants to preserve. What comes must go. The permanent is
beyond all comings and goings. Go to the root of all experience, to the
sense of being. Beyond being and not-being lies the immensity of the
real.

<!--l. 7228--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There must be the desire first. When the desire is strong, the
willingness to try will come. You do not need assurance of success,
when the desire is strong. You are ready to gamble.
<!--l. 7230--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Strong desire, strong faith &#8211; it comes to the same. These people do
not trust either their parents or the society, or even themselves. All
they touched turned to ashes. Give them one experience absolutely
genuine, indubitable, beyond the argumentations of the mind and they
will follow you to the world&#8217;s end.
<!--l. 7232--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But I am doing nothing else! Tirelessly I draw their attention to the
one incontrovertible factor &#8211;
<!--l. 7234--><p class="noindent" >that of being. Being needs no proofs &#8211; it proves all else. If only they go
deeply into the fact of being and discover the vastness and the glory to
which the &#8216;I am&#8217; is the door, and cross the door and go beyond, their

life will be full of happiness and light. Believe me, the effort
needed is as nothing when compared with the discoveries arrived
at.
<!--l. 7236--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What you say is right. But these people have neither confidence nor
patience. Even a short effort tires them. It is really pathetic to see
them groping blindly and yet unable to hold on to the helping hand.
They are such nice people fundamentally but totally bewildered. I tell
them: you cannot have truth on your own terms. You must accept the
conditions. To this they answer: Some will accept the conditions and
some will not. Acceptance or non-acceptance are superficial and
accidental; reality is in all; there must be a way for all to tread &#8211; with
no conditions attached.
<!--l. 7238--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is such a way, open to all, on every level, in every walk of
life. Everybody is aware of himself. The deepening and broadening of
self-awareness is the royal way. Call it mindfulness, or witnessing, or
just attention &#8211; it is for all. None is unripe for it and none can
fail.

modern Western mind and the difficulty it finds in submitting to the
moral and intellectual discipline of the Vedanta. One of the obstacles

disastrous condition of the world and the urgent need of setting it
right.

world-police, world-planning and the abolition of all physical and
ideological barriers: this is enough, no personal transformation is
needed. No doubt, people shape society, but society shapes people too.
In a humane society people will be humane; besides, science provides
the answer to many questions which formerly were in the domain of
religion.
<!--l. 7250--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>No doubt, striving for the improvement of the world is a
most praiseworthy occupation.
<!--l. 7252--><p class="noindent" >Done selflessly, it clarifies the mind and purifies the heart. But soon
man will realise that he pursues a mirage. Local and temporary
improvement is always possible and was achieved again and again
under the influence of a great king or teacher; but it would soon come
to an end, leaving humanity in a new cycle of misery. It is in the
nature of all manifestation that the good and the bad follow
each other and in equal measure. The true refuge is only in the
unmanifested.
<!--l. 7254--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you not advising escape?

<!--l. 7256--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On the contrary. The only way to renewal lies through destruction.
You must melt down the old jewellery into formless gold before you can
mould a new one. Only the people who have gone beyond the world can
change the world. It never happened otherwise. The few whose impact
was long lasting were all knowers of reality. Reach their level and then
only talk of helping the world.
<!--l. 7258--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is not the rivers and mountains that we want to help, but the
people M: There is nothing wrong with the world, but for the people
who make it bad. Go and ask them to behave.
<!--l. 7260--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Desire and fear make them behave as they do.
<!--l. 7262--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Exactly. As long as human behaviour is dominated by desire and
fear, there is not much hope.
<!--l. 7264--><p class="noindent" >And to know how to approach the people effectively, you must yourself
be free of all desire and fear.
<!--l. 7266--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Certain basic desires and fears are inevitable, such as are connected
with food, sex and death.
<!--l. 7268--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>These are needs and, as needs, they are easy to meet.
<!--l. 7270--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even death is a need?
<!--l. 7272--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Having lived a long and fruitful life you feel the need to die. Only
when wrongly applied, desire and fear are destructive. By all means
desire the right and fear the wrong. But when people desire
what is wrong and fear what is right, they create chaos and
despair.
<!--l. 7274--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is right and what is wrong?

<!--l. 7276--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Relatively, what causes suffering is wrong, what alleviates it is
right. Absolutely, what brings you back to reality is right and what
dims reality is wrong.
<!--l. 7278--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When we talk of helping humanity, we mean a struggle against
disorder and suffering.
<!--l. 7280--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You merely talk of helping. Have you ever helped, really helped, a
single man? Have you ever put one soul beyond the need of further
help? Can you give a man character, based on full realisation of his
duties and opportunities at least, if not on the insight into his true
being? When you do not know what is good for yourself, how can you
know what is good for others?
<!--l. 7282--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The adequate supply of means of livelihood is good for all. You
may be God himself, but you need a well-fed body to talk to
us.
<!--l. 7284--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is you that need my body to talk to you. I am not my body, nor
do I need it. I am the witness only. I have no shape of my own. You are
so accustomed to think of yourselves as bodies having consciousness
that you just cannot imagine consciousness as having bodies. Once you
realise that bodily existence is but a state of mind, a movement in
consciousness, that the ocean of consciousness is infinite and
eternal, and that, when in touch with consciousness, you are the
witness only, you will be able to withdraw beyond consciousness
altogether.
<!--l. 7286--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are told there are many levels of existences. Do you exit and
function on all the levels?
<!--l. 7288--><p class="noindent" >While you are on earth, are you also in heaven ( swarga)?
<!--l. 7290--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>! am nowhere to be found! I am not a thing to be given a place

among other things. All things are in me, but I am not among things.
You are telling me about the superstructure while I am concerned with
the foundations. The superstructures rise and fall, but the foundations
last. I am not interested in the transient, while you talk of nothing
else.
<!--l. 7292--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Forgive me a strange question. If somebody with a razor sharp
sword would suddenly severe your head, what difference would it make
to you?
<!--l. 7294--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>None whatsoever. The body will lose its head, certain lines of
communication will be cut, that is all. Two people talk to each other on
the phone and the wire is cut. Nothing happens to the people, only
they must look for some other means of communication. The Bhagavad
Gita says: &#8221;the sword does not cut it&#8221;. It is literally so. It is in the
nature of consciousness to survive its vehicles. It is like fire. It
burns up the fuel, but not itself. Just like a fire can outlast a
mountain of fuel, so does consciousness survive innumerable
bodies.
<!--l. 7296--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The fuel affects the flame.
<!--l. 7298--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as it lasts. Change the nature of the fuel and the colour
and appearance of the flame will change.
<!--l. 7300--><p class="noindent" >Now we are talking to each other. For this presence is needed; unless we
are present, we cannot talk. But presence by itself is not enough. There
must also he the desire to talk.
<!--l. 7302--><p class="noindent" >Above all, we want to remain conscious. We shall bear every
suffering and humiliation, but we shall rather remain conscious.
Unless we revolt against this craving for experience and let go the
manifested altogether, there can be no relief. We shall remain
trapped.

<!--l. 7304--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You say you are the silent witness and also you are beyond
consciousness. Is there no contradiction in it? If you are beyond
consciousness, what are you witnessing to?
<!--l. 7306--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am conscious and unconscious, both conscious and unconscious,
neither conscious nor unconscious &#8211; to all this I am witness &#8211; but really
there is no witness, because there is nothing to be a witness to. I am
perfectly empty of all mental formations, void of mind &#8211; yet fully
aware. This I try to express my saying that I am beyond the
mind.
<!--l. 7308--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I reach you then?
<!--l. 7310--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Be aware of being conscious and seek the source of consciousness.
That is all. Very little can be conveyed in words. It is the doing as I
tell you that will bring light, not my telling you. The means do
not matter much; it is the desire, the urge, the earnestness that
count.

<!--l. 7332--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Talking.
<!--l. 7334--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What are you talking about?
<!--l. 7336--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Do you want a lecture? Better ask something that really
touches you, so that you feel strongly about it. Unless you are
emotionally involved, you may argue with me, but there will be no real
understanding between us. If you say: &#8216;nothing worries me, I
have no problems&#8217;, it is all right with me, we can keep quiet.
But if something really touches you, then there is purpose in
talking.

<!--l. 7338--><p class="noindent" >Shall I ask you? What is the purpose of your moving from place to
place?
<!--l. 7340--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>To meet people, to try to understand them.
<!--l. 7342--><p class="noindent" ><span

after?
<!--l. 7344--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Integration.
<!--l. 7346--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you want integration, you must know whom you want to
integrate.
<!--l. 7348--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By meeting people and watching them, one comes to know oneself
also. It goes together.
<!--l. 7350--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It does not necessarily go together.
<!--l. 7352--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>One improves the other.
<!--l. 7354--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It does not work that way. The mirror reflects the image, but the
image does not improve the mirror. You are neither the mirror nor
the image in the mirror. Having perfected the mirror so that it
reflects correctly, truly, you can turn the mirror round and see in
it a true reflection of yourself &#8211; true as far as the mirror can
reflect. But the reflection is not yourself &#8211; you are the seer of the
reflection.
<!--l. 7356--><p class="noindent" >Do understand it clearly &#8211; whatever you may perceive you are not what
you perceive.
<!--l. 7358--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am the mirror and the world is the image?
<!--l. 7360--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can see both the image and the mirror. You are neither. Who

are you? Don&#8217;t go by formulas. The answer is not in words. The nearest
you can say in words is: I am what makes perception possible, the life
beyond the experiencer and his experience.
<!--l. 7362--><p class="noindent" >Now, Can you separate yourself both from the mirror and the image in
the mirror and stand completely alone, all by yourself?
<!--l. 7364--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No, I cannot.
<!--l. 7366--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How do you know that you cannot? There are so many things you
are doing without knowing how to do it. You digest, you circulate your
blood and lymph, you move your muscles &#8211; all without knowing
how. In the same way, you perceive, you feel, you think without
knowing the why and how of it. Similarly you are yourself without
knowing it. There is nothing wrong with you as the Self. It is
what it is to perfection. It is the mirror that is not clear and
true and, therefore, gives you false images. You need not correct
yourself &#8211; only set right your idea of yourself. Learn to separate
yourself from the image and the mirror, keep on remembering:
I am neither the mind nor its ideas: do it patiently and with
convictions and you will surely come to the direct vision of yourself as
the source of being &#8211; knowing &#8211; loving, eternal, all-embracing
all-pervading. You are the infinite focussed in a body. Now you see the
body only. Try earnestly and you will come to see the infinite
only.
<!--l. 7368--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The experience of reality, when it Comes, does it last?
<!--l. 7370--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All experience is necessarily transient. But the ground of all
experience is immovable. Nothing that may be called an event will last.
But some events purify the mind and some stain it. Moments of deep
insight and all-embracing love purify the mind, while desires and fears,
envies and anger, blind beliefs and intellectual arrogance pollute and
dull the psyche.

<!--l. 7372--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is self-realisation so important?
<!--l. 7374--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Without it you will be consumed by desires and fears, repeating
themselves meaninglessly in endless suffering. Most of the people do
not know that there can be an end to pain. But once they have heard
the good news, obviously going beyond all strife and struggle is the
most urgent task that can be. You know that you can be free
and now it is up to you. Either you remain forever hungry and
thirsty, longing, searching, grabbing, holding, ever losing and
sorrowing, or go out whole-heartedly in search of the state of
timeless perfection to which nothing can be added, from which
nothing &#8211; taken away. In it all desires and fears are absent, not
because they were given up, but because they have lost their
meaning.
<!--l. 7376--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So far I have been following you. Now, what am I expected to
do?
<!--l. 7378--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is nothing to do. Just be. Do nothing. Be. No climbing
mountains and sitting in caves. I do not even say: &#8216;be yourself&#8217;, since
you do not know yourself. Just be. Having seen that you are neither the
&#8216;outer&#8217; world of perceivables, nor the &#8216;inner&#8217; world of thinkables, that
you are neither body nor mind &#8211; just be.
<!--l. 7380--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, there are degrees of realisation.
<!--l. 7382--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There are no steps to self-realisation. There is nothing gradual
about it. It happens suddenly and is irreversible. You rotate into a
new dimension, seen from which the previous ones are mere
abstractions. Just like on sunrise you see things as they are, so on
self-realisation you see everything as it is. The world of illusions is left
behind.
<!--l. 7384--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In the state of realisation do things change? They become colourful

and full of meaning?
<!--l. 7386--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The experience is quite right, but it is not the experience of
reality ( sadanubhav), but of harmony ( satvanubhav) of the
universe.
<!--l. 7388--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Nevertheless, there is progress.
<!--l. 7390--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There can be progress only in the preparation ( sadhana).
realisation is sudden. The fruit ripens slowly, but falls suddenly and
without return.
<!--l. 7392--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am physically and mentally at peace. What more do I need?
<!--l. 7394--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yours may not be the ultimate state. You will recognise that you
have returned to your natural state by a complete absence of
all desire and fear. After all, at the root of all desire and fear
is the feeling of not being what you are. Just as a dislocated
joint pains only as long as it is out of shape, and is forgotten
as soon as it is set right, so is all self-concern a symptom of
mental distortion which disappears as soon as one is in the normal
state.
<!--l. 7396--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, but what is the sadhana for achieving the natural state?
<!--l. 7398--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Hold on to the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; to the exclusion of everything else.
When thus the mind becomes completely silent, it shines with a new
light and vibrates with new knowledge. It all comes spontaneously,
you need only hold on to the &#8216;I am&#8217;. Just like emerging from
sleep or a state of rapture you feel rested and yet you cannot
explain why and how you come to feel so well, in the same way on
realisation you feel complete, fulfilled, free from the pleasure-pain
complex, and yet not always able to explain what happened, why
and how. You can put it only in negative terms: &#8216;Nothing is

wrong with me any longer.&#8217; It is only by comparison with the
past that you know that you are out of it. Otherwise &#8211; you are
just yourself. Don&#8217;t try to convey it to others. If you can, it is
not the real thing. Be silent and watch it expressing itself in
action.
<!--l. 7401--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If you could tell me what I shall become, it may help me to watch
over my development.
<!--l. 7403--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can anybody tell you what you shall become when there is no
becoming? You merely discover what you are. All moulding oneself to a
pattern is a grievous waste of time. Think neither of the past nor of the
future, just be.
<!--l. 7405--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I just be? Changes are inevitable.
<!--l. 7407--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Changes are inevitable in the changeful, but you are not subject to
them. You are the changeless background, against which changes are
perceived.
<!--l. 7409--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Everything changes, the background also changes. There is no
need of a changeless background to notice changes. The self is
momentary &#8211; it is merely the point where the past meets the
future.
<!--l. 7411--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course the self based on memory is momentary. But such self
demands unbroken continuity behind it. You know from experience
that there are gaps when your self is forgotten. What brings it back to
life? What wakes you up in the morning? There must be some constant
factor bridging the gaps in consciousness. If you watch carefully you
will find that even your daily consciousness is in flashes, with gaps
intervening all the time. What is in the gaps? What can there be but
your real being, that is timeless; mind and mindlessness are one to
it.

<!--l. 7413--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there any particular place you would advise me to go to for
spiritual attainment?
<!--l. 7415--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The only proper place is within. The outer world neither can help
nor hinder. No system, no pattern of action will take you to your goal.
Give up all working for a future, concentrate totally on the now, be
concerned only with your response to every movement of life as it
happens.
<!--l. 7417--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the cause of the urge to roam about?
<!--l. 7419--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no cause. You merely dream that you roam about. In a
few years your stay in India will appear as a dream to you. You will
dream some other dream at that time. Do realise that it is not you who
moves from dream to dream, but the dreams flow before you and you
are the immutable witness. No happening affects your real being &#8211; this
is the absolute truth.
<!--l. 7421--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Cannot I move about physically and keep steady inwardly?
<!--l. 7423--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can, but what purpose does it serve? If you are earnest, you
will find that in the end you will get fed up with roaming and regret
the waste of energy and time. To find your self you need not take a
single step.
<!--l. 7425--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there any difference between the experience of the Self ( atman)
and of the Absolute ( brahman)?
<!--l. 7427--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There can be no experience of the Absolute as it is beyond all
experience. On the other hand, the self is the experiencing factor in
every experience and thus, in a way, validates the multiplicity of
experiences. The world may be full of things of great value, but if there
is nobody to buy them, they have no price. The Absolute contains
everything experienceable, but without the experience they are as

nothing. That which makes the experience possible is the Absolute.
That which makes it actual is the Self.
<!--l. 7429--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Don&#8217;t we reach the Absolute through a gradation of experiences?
Beginning with the grossest, we end with the most sublime.
<!--l. 7431--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There can be no experience without desire for it. There can be
gradation between desires, but between the most sublime desire and
the freedom from all desire there is an abyss which must be crossed.
The unreal may look real, but it is transient. The real is not afraid of
time.
<!--l. 7433--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not the unreal the expression of the real?
<!--l. 7435--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can it be? It is like saying that truth expresses itself in
dreams. To the real the unreal is not.
<!--l. 7437--><p class="noindent" >It appears to be real only because you believe in it. Doubt it, and it
ceases. When you are in love with somebody, you give it reality &#8211; you
imagine your love to be all-powerful and everlasting. When it comes to
an end, you say: &#8216;I thought it was real, but it wasn&#8217;t&#8217;. Transiency is the
best proof of unreality. What is limited in time and space, and
applicable to one person only, is not real. The real is for all and
forever.
<!--l. 7439--><p class="noindent" >Above everything else you cherish yourself. You would accept nothing
in exchange for your existence. The desire to be is the strongest
of all desires and will go only on the realisation of your true
nature.
<!--l. 7441--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even in the unreal there is a touch of reality.
<!--l. 7443--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, the reality you impart to it by taking it to be real. Having
convinced yourself, you are bound by your conviction. When the sun

shines, colours appear. When it sets, they disappear. Where are the
colours without the light?
<!--l. 7445--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This is thinking in terms of duality.
<!--l. 7447--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All thinking is in duality. In identity no thought survives.

<!--l. 7471--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You must unlearn everything. God is the end of all desire and
knowledge.
<!--l. 7473--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You mean to say that I become God merely by giving up the desire
to become God?
<!--l. 7475--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All desires must be given up, because by desiring you take the
shape of your desires. When no desires remain, you revert to your
natural state.
<!--l. 7477--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do I come to know that I have achieved perfection?
<!--l. 7479--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can not know perfection, you can know only imperfection. For
knowledge to be, there must be separation and disharmony. You can
know what you are not, but you can not know your real being. You can
be only what you are. The entire approach is through understanding,
which is in the seeing of the false as false. But to understand, you must
observe from outside.
<!--l. 7481--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The Vedantic concept of Maya, illusion, applies to the manifested.
Therefore our knowledge of the manifested is unreliable. But we should
be able to trust our knowledge of the unmanifested.
<!--l. 7483--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There can be no knowledge of the unmanifested. The potential is
unknowable. Only the actual can be known.
<!--l. 7485--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should the knower remain unknown?
<!--l. 7487--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The knower knows the known. Do you know the knower? Who is
the knower of the knower?
<!--l. 7489--><p class="noindent" >You want to know the unmanifested. Can you say you know the
manifested?

<!--l. 7491--><p class="noindent" ><span

my experiences.

<!--l. 7495--><p class="noindent" ><span

happen.
<!--l. 7497--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If the manifested is the sum total of all actual experiences,
including their experiencers, how much of the total do you know? A
very small part indeed. And what is the little you know?
<!--l. 7499--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Some sensory experiences as related to myself.
<!--l. 7501--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not even that. You only know that you react. Who reacts and to
what, you do not know. You know on contact that you exist &#8211; &#8216;I am&#8217;.
The &#8216;I am this&#8217;, &#8216;I am that&#8217; are imaginary.
<!--l. 7503--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I know the manifested because I participate in it. I admit, my part
in it is very small, yet it is as real as the totality of it. And what is
more important, I give it meaning. Without me the world is dark and
silent.
<!--l. 7505--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A firefly illumining the world! You don&#8217;t give meaning to the world,
you find it. Dive deep into yourself and find the source from where all
meaning flows. Surely it is not the superficial mind that can give
meaning.
<!--l. 7507--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What makes me limited and superficial?
<!--l. 7509--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The total is open and available, but you will not take it. You are
attached to the little person you think yourself to be. Your desires are
narrow, your ambitions &#8211; petty. After all, without a centre of
perception where would be the manifested? Unperceived, the

manifested is as good as the unmanifested. And you are the perceiving
point, the non-dimensional source of all dimensions.

<!--l. 7515--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is enough space in a point for an infinity of universes. There
is no lack of capacity. Self-limitation is the only problem. But you
cannot run away from yourself. However far you go, you come back to
yourself and to the need of understanding this point, which is as
nothing and yet the source of everything.
<!--l. 7517--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I came to India in search of a Yoga teacher. I am still in
search.
<!--l. 7519--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What kind of Yoga do you want to practice, the Yoga of getting, or
the Yoga of giving up?
<!--l. 7521--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Don&#8217;t they come to the same in the end?
<!--l. 7523--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can they? One enslaves, the other liberates. The motive
matters supremely. Freedom comes through renunciation. All
possession is bondage.
<!--l. 7525--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What I have the strength and the courage to hold on to, why
should I give up? And if I have not the strength, how can I give
up? I do not understand this need of giving up. When I want
something, why should I not pursue it? Renunciation is for the
weak.
<!--l. 7527--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you do not have the wisdom and the strength to give up, just
look at your possessions. Your mere looking will burn them up. If you
can stand outside your mind, you will soon find that total renunciation

of possessions and desires is the most obviously reasonable thing to do.
You create the world and then worry about it. Becoming selfish makes
you weak. If you think you have the strength and courage to desire, it
is because you are young and inexperienced. Invariably the object of
desire destroys the means of acquiring it and then itself withers away.
It is all for the best, because it teaches you to shun desire like
poison.
<!--l. 7529--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to practice desirelessness?
<!--l. 7531--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No need of practice. No need of any acts of renunciation. Just turn
your mind away, that is all.
<!--l. 7533--><p class="noindent" >Desire is merely the fixation of the mind on an idea. Get it out of its
groove by denying it attention.
<!--l. 7535--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>That is all?
<!--l. 7537--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, that is all. Whatever may be the desire or fear, don&#8217;t dwell
upon it. Try and see for yourself.
<!--l. 7539--><p class="noindent" >Here and there you may forget, it does not matter. Go back to your
attempts till the brushing away of every desire and fear, of every
reaction becomes automatic.
<!--l. 7541--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can one live without emotions?
<!--l. 7543--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can have all the emotions you want, but beware of reactions, of
induced emotions. Be entirely self-determined and ruled from within,
not from without. Merely giving up a thing to secure a better
one is not true relinquishment. Give it up because you see its
valuelessness. As you keep on giving up, you will find that you grow
spontaneously in intelligence and power and inexhaustible love and
joy.

<!--l. 7545--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why so much insistence on relinquishing all desires and fears? Are
they not natural?
<!--l. 7547--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They are not. They are entirely mind-made. You have to give up
everything to know that you need nothing, not even your body.
Your needs are unreal and your efforts are meaningless. You
imagine that your possessions protect you. In reality they make
you vulnerable. realise yourself as away from all that can be
pointed at as &#8216;this&#8217; or &#8216;that&#8217;. You are unreachable by any sensory
experience or verbal construction. Turn away from them. Refuse to
impersonate.
<!--l. 7549--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>After I have heard you, what am I to do?
<!--l. 7551--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Only hearing will not help you much. You must keep it in mind and
ponder over it and try to understand the state of mind which makes me
say what I say. I speak from truth; stretch your hand and take it. You
are not what you think yourself to be, I assure you. The image
you have of yourself is made up from memories and is purely
accidental.
<!--l. 7553--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What I am is the result of my karma.
<!--l. 7555--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What you appear to be, you are not. Karma is only a word
you have learnt to repeat. You have never been, nor shall ever
be a person. Refuse to consider yourself as one. But as long as
you do not even doubt yourself to be a Mr. S0-and-so, there is
little hope. When you refuse to open your eyes, what can you be
shown?
<!--l. 7557--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I imagine karma to be a mysterious power that urges me towards
perfection.
<!--l. 7559--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That&#8217;s what people told you. You are already perfect, here and

now. The perfectible is not you.
<!--l. 7561--><p class="noindent" >You imagine yourself to be what you are not &#8211; stop it. It is the
cessation that is important, not what you are going to stop.
<!--l. 7563--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Did not karma compel me to become what I am?
<!--l. 7565--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing compels. You are as you believe yourself to be. Stop
believing.
<!--l. 7567--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Here you are sitting on your seat and talking to me. What compels
you is your karma.
<!--l. 7569--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing compels me. I do what needs doing. But you do so many
unnecessary things. It is your refusal to examine that creates
karma. It is the indifference to your own suffering that perpetuates
it.
<!--l. 7571--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, it is true. What can put an end to this indifference?
<!--l. 7573--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The urge must come from within as a wave of detachment, or
compassion.
<!--l. 7575--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Could I meet this urge half way?
<!--l. 7577--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. See your own condition, see the condition of the
world.
<!--l. 7579--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We were told about karma and reincarnation, evolution and
Yoga, masters and disciples. What are we to do with all this
knowledge?
<!--l. 7581--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Leave it all behind you. Forget it. Go forth, unburdened with ideas
and beliefs. Abandon all verbal structures, all relative truth, all

tangible objectives. The Absolute can be reached by absolute devotion
only. Don&#8217;t be half-hearted.
<!--l. 7583--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I must begin with some absolute truth. Is there any?
<!--l. 7585--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, there is, the feeling: &#8216;I am&#8217;. Begin with that.
<!--l. 7587--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Nothing else is true?
<!--l. 7589--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All else is neither true nor false. It seems real when it appears, it
disappears when it is denied. A transient thing is a mystery.
<!--l. 7591--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I thought the real is the mystery.
<!--l. 7593--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can it be? The real is simple, open, clear and kind, beautiful
and joyous. It is completely free of contradictions. It is ever new, ever
fresh, endlessly creative. Being and non-being, life and death, all
distinctions merge in it.
<!--l. 7595--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can admit that all is false. But, does it make my mind
nonexistent?
<!--l. 7597--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 7599--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If the shape of things is mere appearance, what are they in
reality?
<!--l. 7601--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In reality there is only perception. The perceiver and the perceived
are conceptual, the fact of perceiving is actual.
<!--l. 7603--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Where does the Absolute come in?
<!--l. 7605--><p class="noindent" ><span

possible.

<!--l. 7607--><p class="noindent" >But too much analysis leads you nowhere. There is in you the core of
being which is beyond analysis, beyond the mind. You can know it in
action only. Express it in daily life and its light will grow ever
brighter.
<!--l. 7609--><p class="noindent" >The legitimate function of the mind is to tell you what is not.
But if you want positive knowledge, you must go beyond the

<!--l. 7617--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>It is our repeated experience that the disciples do much
harm to their Gurus. They make plans and carry them out, without
considering the Guru&#8217;s wishes. In the end there is only endless worry
for the Guru and bitterness for his disciples.
<!--l. 7619--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Yes, it does happen.
<!--l. 7621--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who compels the Guru to submit to these indignities?
<!--l. 7623--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The Guru is basically without desire. He sees what happens,
but feels no urge to interfere. He makes no choices, takes no
decisions. As pure witness, he watches what is going on and remains
unaffected.
<!--l. 7625--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But his work suffers.
<!--l. 7627--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Victory is always his &#8211; in the end. He knows that if the disciples do
not learn from his words, they will learn from their own mistakes.
Inwardly he remains quiet and silent. He has no sense of being a
separate person. The entire universe is his own, including his disciples
with their petty plans. Nothing in particular affects him, or,
which comes to the same, the entire universe affects him in equal
measure.
<!--l. 7629--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no such thing as the Guru&#8217;s grace?
<!--l. 7631--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>His grace is constant and universal. It is not given to one and
denied to another.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does it affect me personally?
<!--l. 7635--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is by The Guru&#8217;s grace that your mind is engaged in search for

truth and it is by his grace that you will find it. It works unwaringly
towards your ultimate good. And it is for all.
<!--l. 7637--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Some disciples are ready, mature, and some are not. Must not the
Guru exercise choice and make decisions?
<!--l. 7639--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The Guru knows the Ultimate and relentlessly propels the disciple
towards it. The disciple is full of obstacles, which he himself
must overcome. The Guru is not very much concerned with the
superficialities of the disciple&#8217;s life. It is like gravitation The fruit must
fall &#8211; when no longer held back.
<!--l. 7641--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If the disciple does not know the goal, how can he make out the
obstacles?
<!--l. 7643--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The goal is shown by the Guru, obstacles are discovered by the
disciple. The Guru has no preferences, but those who have obstacles to
overcome seem to be lagging behind.
<!--l. 7645--><p class="noindent" >In reality the disciple is not different from the Guru. He is the same
dimensionless centre of perception and love in action. It is only his
imagination and self-identification with the imagined, that encloses him
and converts him into a person. The Guru is concerned little with the
person. His attention is on the inner watcher. It is the task of the
watcher to understand and thereby eliminate the person. While there is
grace on one side, there must be dedication to the task on the
other.
<!--l. 7647--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But the person does not want to be eliminated.
<!--l. 7649--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The person is merely the result of a misunderstanding. In reality,
there is no such thing.
<!--l. 7651--><p class="noindent" >Feelings, thoughts and actions race before the watcher in endless

succession, leaving traces in the brain and creating an illusion of
continuity. A reflection of the watcher in the mind creates the
sense of &#8216;I&#8217; and the person acquires an apparently independent
existence. In reality there is no person, only the watcher identifying
himself with the &#8216;I&#8217; and the &#8216;mine&#8217;. The teacher tells the watcher:
you are not this, there is nothing of yours in this, except the
little point of &#8216;I am&#8217;, which is the bridge between the watcher
and his dream. &#8216;I am this, I am that&#8217; is dream, while pure &#8216;I
am&#8217; has the stamp of reality on it. You have tasted so many

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Which obstacles?
<!--l. 7661--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Desire for the false and fear of the true. You, as the person, imagine
that the Guru is interested in you as a person. Not at all. To him you
are a nuisance and a hindrance to be done away with. He actually aims
at your elimination as a factor in consciousness.
<!--l. 7663--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I am eliminated, what will remain?
<!--l. 7665--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing will remain, all will remain. The sense of identity will
remain, but no longer identification with a particular body. Being &#8211;
awareness &#8211; love will shine in full splendour. Liberation is never of the
person, it is always from the person.
<!--l. 7667--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And no trace remains of the person?

<!--l. 7669--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A vague memory remains, like the memory of a dream, or early
childhood. After all, what is there to remember? A flow of events,
mostly accidental and meaningless. A sequence of desires and fears and
inane blunders. Is there anything worth remembering? The person is
but a shell imprisoning you. Break the shell.
<!--l. 7671--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Whom are you asking to break the shell? Who is to break the
shell?
<!--l. 7673--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Break the bonds of memory and self-identification and the shell will
break by itself. There is a centre that imparts reality to whatever it
perceives. All you need is to understand that you are the source of
reality, that you give reality instead of getting it, that you need no
support and no confirmation. Things are as they are, because you
accept them as they are. Stop accepting them and they will dissolve.
Whatever you think about with desire or fear appears before you as
real.
<!--l. 7675--><p class="noindent" >Look at it without desire or fear and it does lose substance. Pleasure
and pain are momentary. It is simpler and easier to disregard them
than to act on them.
<!--l. 7677--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If all things come to an end, why did they appear at all?
<!--l. 7679--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Creation is in the very nature of consciousness. Consciousness
causes appearances. Reality is beyond consciousness.
<!--l. 7681--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>While we are conscious of appearances, how is it that we are not
conscious that these are mere appearances?
<!--l. 7683--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind covers up reality, without knowing it. To know the
nature of the mind, you need intelligence, the capacity to look at the
mind in silent and dispassionate awareness.

<!--l. 7685--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I am of the nature of all-pervading consciousness, how could
ignorance and illusion happen to me?
<!--l. 7687--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither ignorance nor illusion ever happened to you. Find the self
to which you ascribe ignorance and illusion and your question will be
answered. You talk as if you know the self and see it to be under the
sway of ignorance and illusion. But, in fact, you do not know
the self, nor are you aware of ignorance. By all means become
aware &#8211; this will bring you to the self and you will realise that
there is neither ignorance nor delusion in it. It is like saying: if
there is sun, how can darkness be? As under a stone there will
be darkness, however strong the sunlight, so in the shadow of
the &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; consciousness there must be ignorance and
illusion.
<!--l. 7689--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But why did the body consciousness come into being?
<!--l. 7691--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t ask &#8216;why&#8217;, ask &#8216;how&#8217;. It is in the nature of creative
imagination to identify itself with its creations. You can stop it any
moment by switching off attention. Or through investigation.

<!--l. 7695--><p class="noindent" ><span

not happy for various reasons. He goes out in search of happiness,
meets a Guru who tells him: &#8216;You are not a person, find who you are&#8217;.
He does it and goes beyond.

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Desires and fears have dulled your mind. It needs some scrubbing.
<!--l. 7713--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I clear my mind?
<!--l. 7715--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By watching it relentlessly. Inattention obscures, attention
clarifies.
<!--l. 7717--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why do the Indian teachers advocate inactivity?
<!--l. 7719--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Most of people&#8217;s activities are valueless, if not outright destructive.
Dominated by desire and fear, they can do nothing good. Ceasing to do
evil precedes beginning to do good. Hence the need for stopping all
activities for a time, to investigate one&#8217;s urges and their motives, see all
that is false in one&#8217;s life, purge the mind of all evil and then only
restart work, beginning with one&#8217;s obvious duties. Of course, if you
have a chance to help somebody, by all means do it and promptly too,
don&#8217;t keep him waiting till you are perfect. But do not become a
professional do-gooder.
<!--l. 7721--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do not feel there are too many do-gooders among disciples. Most
of those I met are too absorbed in their own petty conflicts. They have
no heart for others.
<!--l. 7723--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Such self-centeredness is temporary. Be patient with such people.
For so many years they gave attention to everything but themselves.
Let them turn to themselves for a change.

<!--l. 7725--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What are the fruits of self-awareness?
<!--l. 7727--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You grow more intelligent. In awareness you learn. In self-awareness
you learn about yourself.
<!--l. 7729--><p class="noindent" >Of course, you can only learn what you are not. To know what you are,
you must go beyond the mind.
<!--l. 7731--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not awareness beyond the mind?
<!--l. 7733--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Awareness is the point at which the mind reaches out beyond itself
into reality. In awareness you seek not what pleases, but what is
true.
<!--l. 7735--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find that awareness brings about a state of inner silence, a state of
psychic void.
<!--l. 7737--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is all right as it goes, but it is not enough. Have you felt the
all-embracing emptiness in which the universe swims like a cloud in the
blue sky?
<!--l. 7739--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, let me first come to know well my own inner space.
<!--l. 7741--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Destroy the wall that separates, the &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; idea and the
inner and the outer will become one.
<!--l. 7743--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Am I to die?
<!--l. 7745--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Physical destruction is meaningless. It is the clinging to sensate life
that binds you. If you could experience the inner void fully, the
explosion into the totality would be near.
<!--l. 7747--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My own spiritual experience has its seasons. Sometimes I feel
glorious, then again I am down. I am like a little boy &#8211; going up, going

down, going up, going down.
<!--l. 7749--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All changes in consciousness are due to the &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; idea.
Divested of this idea the mind becomes steady. There is pure being,
free of experiencing anything in particular. But to realise it you must
do what your teacher tells you. Mere listening, even memorizing, is not
enough. If you do not struggle hard to apply every word of it in your
daily life, don&#8217;t complain that you made no progress. All real
progress is irreversible. Ups and downs merely show that the
teaching has not been taken to heart and translated into action
fully.
<!--l. 7751--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The other day you told us that there is no such thing as karma. Yet
we see that every thing has a cause and the sum total of all the causes
may be called karma.
<!--l. 7753--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you believe yourself to be a body, you will ascribe causes
to everything. I do not say things have no causes. Each thing has
innumerable causes. It is as it is, because the world is as it is. Every
cause in its ramifications covers the universe.
<!--l. 7755--><p class="noindent" >When you realise that you are absolutely free to be what you consent
to be, that you are what you appear to be because of ignorance or
indifference, you are free to revolt and change. You allow yourself to be
what you are not. You are looking for the causes of being what you are
not! It is a futile search. There are no causes, but your ignorance of
your real being, which is perfect and beyond all causation. For
whatever happens, all the universe is responsible and you are the
source of the universe.
<!--l. 7757--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I know nothing about being the cause of the universe.
<!--l. 7759--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because you do not investigate. Enquire, search within and you will
know.

<!--l. 7761--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can a speck like me create the vast universe?
<!--l. 7763--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you are infected with the &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; virus; a whole
universe springs into being. But when you have had enough of
it, you cherish some fanciful ideas about liberation and pursue
lines of action totally futile. You concentrate, you meditate, you
torture your mind and body, you do all sorts of unnecessary
things, but you miss the essential which is the elimination of the
person.
<!--l. 7765--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In the beginning we may have to pray and meditate for some time
before we are ready for self-enquiry.
<!--l. 7767--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you believe so, go on. To me, all delay is a waste of time. You can
skip all the preparation and go directly for the ultimate search within.
Of all the Yogas it is the simplest and the shortest.

 id="x1-7700072"></a>What is Pure, Unalloyed, Unattached is Real</h2>
<!--l. 7771--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You are back in India! Where have you been, what have you
seen?
<!--l. 7773--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I come from Switzerland. I stayed there with a
remarkable man who claims to have realised. He has done many Yogas
in his past and had many experiences that passed away. Now he claims
no special abilities, nor knowledge; the only unusual thing about him is
connected with sensations; he is unable to separate the seer from the
seen. For instance, when he sees a car rushing at him, he does not know
whether the car is rushing at him, or he at a car. He seems to
be both at the same time, the seer and the seen. They become
one. Whatever he sees, he sees himself. When I asked him some
Vedantic questions he said: &#8216;I really cannot answer. I do not
know.
<!--l. 7775--><p class="noindent" >All I know is this strange identity with whatever I perceive. You know,
I expected anything but this.&#8217;
<!--l. 7777--><p class="noindent" >He is on the whole a humble man; he makes no disciples and in no way
puts himself on a pedestal.
<!--l. 7779--><p class="noindent" >He is willing to talk about his strange condition, but that is
all.
<!--l. 7781--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Now he knows what he knows. All else is over. At least he still
talks. Soon he may cease talking.
<!--l. 7783--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What will he do then?
<!--l. 7785--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Immobility and silence are not inactive. The flower fills the space
with perfume, the candle &#8211;

<!--l. 7787--><p class="noindent" >with light. They do nothing yet they change everything by their
mere presence. You can photograph the candle, but not its light.
You can know the man, his name and appearance, but not his
influence.
<!--l. 7789--><p class="noindent" >His very presence is action.
<!--l. 7791--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it not natural to be active?
<!--l. 7793--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everybody wants to be active, but where do his actions originate?
There is no central point each action begets another, meaninglessly and
painfully, in endless succession. The alternation of work and
pause is not there. First find the immutable centre where all
movement takes birth. Just like a wheel turns round an axle, so must
you be always at the axle in the centre and not whirling at the
periphery.
<!--l. 7795--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do I go about it in practice?
<!--l. 7797--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Whenever a thought or emotion of desire or fear comes to your
mind, just turn away from it.
<!--l. 7799--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By suppressing my thoughts and feelings I shall provoke a
reaction.
<!--l. 7801--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am not talking of suppression. Just refuse attention.
<!--l. 7803--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must I not use effort to arrest the movements of the mind?
<!--l. 7805--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It has nothing to do with effort. Just turn away, look between the
thoughts, rather than at the thoughts. When you happen to walk in a
crowd, you do not fight every man you meet &#8211; you just find your way
between.

<!--l. 7807--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I use my will to control the mind, it only strengthens the
ego.
<!--l. 7809--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. When you fight, you invite a fight. But when you do not
resist, you meet with no resistance. When you refuse to play the game,
you are out of it.
<!--l. 7811--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How long will it take me to get free of the mind?
<!--l. 7813--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It may take a thousand years, but really no time is required. All
you need is to be in dead earnest. Here the will is the deed. If you are
sincere, you have it. After all, it is a matter of attitude.
<!--l. 7815--><p class="noindent" >Nothing stops you from being a jnani here and now, except fear.
You are afraid of being impersonal, of impersonal being. It is all
quite simple. Turn away from your desires and fears and from
the thoughts they create and you are at once in your natural
state.
<!--l. 7817--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No question of reconditioning, changing, or eliminating the
mind?
<!--l. 7819--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Absolutely none. Leave your mind alone, that is all. Don&#8217;t go along
with it. After all, there is no such thing as mind apart from thoughts
which come and go obeying their own laws, not yours. They dominate
you only because you are interested in them. It is exactly as Christ said
&#8216;Resist not evil&#8217;.
<!--l. 7821--><p class="noindent" >By resisting evil you merely strengthen it.
<!--l. 7823--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, I see now. All I have to do is to deny existence to evil.
Then it fades away. But does it not boil down to some kind of
auto-suggestion?

<!--l. 7825--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The auto-suggestion is in full swing now, when you think yourself
to be a person, caught between good and evil. What I am asking you to
do is to put an end to it, to wake up and see things as they
are.
<!--l. 7827--><p class="noindent" >About your stay in Switzerland with that strange friend of yours: what
did you gain in his company?
<!--l. 7829--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Nothing absolutely. His experience did not affect me at all. One
thing I have understood: there is nothing to search for. Wherever I may
go, nothing waits for me at the end of the journey.
<!--l. 7831--><p class="noindent" >Discovery is not the result of transportation.
<!--l. 7833--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, you are quite apart from anything that can be gained or
lost.
<!--l. 7835--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you call it vairagya, relinquishment, renunciation?
<!--l. 7837--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is nothing to renounce. Enough if you stop acquiring. To give
you must have, and to have you must take. Better don&#8217;t take. It is
simpler than to practice renunciation, which leads to a dangerous form
of &#8216;spiritual&#8217; pride.
<!--l. 7839--><p class="noindent" >All this weighing, selecting, choosing, exchanging &#8211; it is all shopping in
some &#8216;spiritual&#8217; market.
<!--l. 7841--><p class="noindent" >What is your business there? What deal are you out to strike? When
you are not out for business, what is the use of this endless anxiety of
choice? Restlessness takes you nowhere. Something prevents you from
seeing that there is nothing you need. Find it out and see its
falseness. It is like having swallowed some poison and suffering from
unquenchable craving for water. Instead of drinking beyond all
measure, why not eliminate the poison and be free of this burning

thirst?
<!--l. 7843--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I shall have to eliminate the ego!
<!--l. 7845--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The sense &#8216;I am a person in time and space&#8217; is the poison. In a way,
time itself is the poison. In time all things come to an end and new
are born, to be devoured in their turn. Do not identify yourself
with time, do not ask anxiously: &#8216;what next, what next?&#8217; Step
out of time and see it devour the world. Say: &#8216;Well, it is in the
nature of time to put an end to everything. Let it be. It does
not concern me. I am not combustible, nor do I need to collect
fuel&#8217;.
<!--l. 7847--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can the witness be without the things to witness?
<!--l. 7849--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is always something to witness. If not a thing, then its
absence. Witnessing is natural and no problem. The problem is
excessive interest, leading to self-identification. Whatever you are
engrossed in you take to be real.
<!--l. 7851--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is the &#8216;I am&#8217; real or unreal? Is the &#8216;I am&#8217; the witness? Is the witness
real or unreal?
<!--l. 7853--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is pure, unalloyed, unattached, is real. What is tainted,
mixed up, dependent and transient is unreal. Do not be misled by
words &#8211; one word may convey several and even contradictory meanings.
The &#8216;I am&#8217; that pursues the pleasant and shuns the unpleasant is false;
the &#8216;I am&#8217; that sees pleasure and pain as inseparable sees rightly. The
witness that is enmeshed in what he perceives is the person; the
witness who stands aloof, unmoved and untouched, is the watch-tower
of the real, the point at which awareness, inherent in the unmanifested,
contacts the manifested.
<!--l. 7855--><p class="noindent" >There can be no universe without the witness, there can be no witness

without the universe.
<!--l. 7857--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Time consumes the world. Who is the witness of time?
<!--l. 7859--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He who is beyond time &#8211; the Un-nameable. A glowing ember,
moved round and round quickly enough, appears as a glowing circle.
When the movement ceases, the ember remains. Similarly, the &#8216;I am&#8217; in
movement creates the world. The &#8216;I am&#8217; at peace becomes the
Absolute. You are like a man with an electric torch walking through a
gallery. You can see only what is within the beam. The rest is in
darkness.
<!--l. 7861--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I project the world, I should be able to change it.
<!--l. 7863--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course, you can. But you must cease identifying yourself
with it and go beyond. Then you have the power to destroy and
re-create.
<!--l. 7865--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All I want is to be free.
<!--l. 7867--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You must know two things: What are you to be free from and what
keeps you bound.
<!--l. 7869--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why do you want to annihilate the universe?
<!--l. 7871--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am not concerned with the universe. Let it be or not be. It is
enough if I know myself.
<!--l. 7873--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If you are beyond the world, then you are of no use to the
world.
<!--l. 7875--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pity the self that is, not the world that is not! Engrossed in a
dream you have forgotten your true self.

<!--l. 7877--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Without the world there is no place for love.
<!--l. 7879--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite so. All these attributes; being, consciousness, love
and beauty are reflections of the real in the world. No real &#8211; no
reflection.
<!--l. 7881--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The world is full of desirable things and people. How can I imagine
it non-existent?
<!--l. 7883--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Leave the desirable to those who desire. Change the current of your
desire from taking to giving. The passion for giving, for sharing, will
naturally wash the idea of an external world out of your mind, and of
giving as well. Only the pure radiance of love will remain, beyond
giving and receiving.
<!--l. 7885--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In love there must be duality, the lover and the beloved.
<!--l. 7887--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In love there is not the one even, how can there be two? Love is the
refusal to separate, to make distinctions. Before you can think
of unity, you must first create duality. When you truly love,
you do not say: &#8216;I love you&#8217;; where there is mentation, there is
duality.
<!--l. 7889--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is it that brings me again and again to India? It cannot be
only the comparative cheapness of life here? Nor the colourfulness and
variety of impressions. There must be some more important
factor.
<!--l. 7891--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is also the spiritual aspect. The division between the
outer and the inner is less in India. It is easier here to express
the inner in the outer. Integration is easier. Society is not so
oppressive.
<!--l. 7893--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, in the West it is all tamas and rajas. In India there is more of

sattva, of harmony and balance.
<!--l. 7895--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Can&#8217;t you go beyond the gunas? Why choose the sattva? Be what
you are, wherever you are and worry not about gunas.
<!--l. 7897--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have not the strength.
<!--l. 7899--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It merely shows that you have gained little in India. What you
truly have you cannot lose. Were you well-grounded in your self, change
of place would not affect it.
<!--l. 7901--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In India spiritual life is easy. It is not so in the West. One has to
conform to environment to a much greater extent.
<!--l. 7903--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why don&#8217;t you create your own environment? The world has only
as much power over you as you give it. Rebel. Go beyond duality, make
no difference between east and west.
<!--l. 7905--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What can one do when one finds oneself in a very unspiritual
environment?
<!--l. 7907--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Do nothing. Be yourself. Stay out. Look beyond.
<!--l. 7909--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There may be clashes at home. Parents rarely understand.
<!--l. 7911--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you know your true being, you have no problems. You
may please your parents or not, marry or not, make a lot of
money or not; it is all the same to you. Just act according to
circumstances, yet in close touch with the facts, with the reality in
every situation.
<!--l. 7913--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it not a very high state?
<!--l. 7915--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Oh no, it is the normal state. You call it high because you are

afraid of it. First be free from fear.
<!--l. 7917--><p class="noindent" >See that there is nothing to be afraid of. Fearlessness is the door to the
Supreme.
<!--l. 7919--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No amount of effort can make me fearless.
<!--l. 7921--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Fearlessness comes by itself, when you see that there is nothing to
be afraid of. When you walk in a crowded street, you just bypass
people. Some you see, some you just glance at, but you do not stop. It
is the stopping that creates the bottleneck. Keep moving! Disregard
names and shapes, don&#8217;t be attached to them; your attachment is your
bondage.
<!--l. 7923--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What should I do when a man slaps me on my face?
<!--l. 7925--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You will react according to your character, inborn or acquired.
<!--l. 7927--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it inevitable? Am I, is the world, condemned to remain as we
are?
<!--l. 7929--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A jeweller who wants to refashion an ornament, first melts it town
to shapeless gold. Similarly, one must return to one&#8217;s original state
before a new name and form can emerge. Death is essential for
renewal.
<!--l. 7931--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You are always stressing the need of going beyond, of aloofness, of
solitude. You hardly ever use the words &#8216;right&#8217; and &#8216;wrong&#8217;. Why is it
so?
<!--l. 7933--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is right to be oneself, it is wrong not to be. All else is conditional.
You are eager to separate right from wrong, because you need some
basis for action. You are always after doing something or other. But,
personally motivated action, based on some scale of values, aiming

at some result is worse than inaction, for its fruits are always
bitter.
<!--l. 7935--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are awareness and love one and the same?
<!--l. 7937--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course. Awareness is dynamic, love is being. Awareness is
love in action. By itself the mind can actualise any number of
possibilities, but unless they are prompted by love, they are
valueless.
<!--l. 7939--><p class="noindent" >Love precedes creation. Without it there is only chaos.
<!--l. 7941--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Where is the action in awareness?

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are so incurably operational! Unless there is movement,
restlessness, turmoil, you do not call it action. Chaos is movement for
movement&#8217;s sake. True action does not displace; it transforms.
<!--l. 7945--><p class="noindent" >A change of place is mere transportation; a change of heart is action.

of itself. It is an endless process, the transitory begetting the
transitory. It is your ego that makes you think that there must be a
doer. You create a God to your own Image, however dismal the
image. Through the film of your mind you project a world and

<!--l. 8015--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Oh no, you are compelled to desire. In Hinduism the very idea of
free will is non-existent, so there is no word for it. Will is commitment,
fixation, bondage.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am free to choose my limitations.
<!--l. 8019--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You must be free first. To be free in the world you must be
free of the world. Otherwise your past decides for you and your
future. Between what had happened and what must happen
you are caught. Call it destiny or karma, but never &#8211; freedom.
First return to your true being and then act from the heart of
love.
<!--l. 8021--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Within the manifested what is the stamp of the unmanifested?
<!--l. 8023--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is none. The moment you begin to look for the stamp of the
unmanifested, the manifested dissolves. If you try to understand the
unmanifested with the mind, you at once go beyond the mind, like
when you stir the fire with a wooden stick, you burn the stick. Use the
mind to investigate the manifested. Be like the chick that pecks at the
shell. Speculating about life outside the shell would have been of
little use to it, but pecking at the shell breaks the shell from
within and liberates the chick. Similarly, break the mind from

within by investigation and exposure of its contradictions and
absurdities.
<!--l. 8025--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The longing to break the shell, where does it come from?

person? Does not the ego have its value?
<!--l. 8033--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>The person is of little use. It is deeply involved in its own
affairs and is completely ignorant of its true being. Unless the
witnessing consciousness begins to play on the person and it becomes
the object of observation rather than the subject, realisation is not
feasible. It is the witness that makes realisation desirable and
attainable.
<!--l. 8035--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There comes a point in a person&#8217;s life when it becomes the
witness.
<!--l. 8037--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Oh, no. The person by itself will not become the witness. It is like
expecting a cold candle to start burning in the course of time. The
person can stay in the darkness of ignorance forever, unless the flame of
awareness touches it.
<!--l. 8039--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who lights the candle?
<!--l. 8041--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The Guru. His words, his presence. In India it is very often the
mantra. Once the candle is lighted, the flame will consume the
candle.
<!--l. 8043--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why is the mantra so effective?
<!--l. 8045--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Constant repetition of the mantra is something the person does not
do for one&#8217;s own sake. The beneficiary is not the person. Just like the
candle which does not increase by burning.
<!--l. 8047--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can the person become aware of itself by itself?

<!--l. 8049--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, it happens sometimes as a result of much suffering The Guru
wants to save you the endless pain. Such is his grace. Even when there
is no discoverable outer Guru, there is always the sadguru, the inner
Guru, who directs and helps from within. The words &#8216;outer&#8217; and &#8216;inner&#8217;
are relative to the body only; in reality all is one, the outer being
merely a projection of the inner. Awareness comes as if from a higher
dimension.
<!--l. 8051--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Before the spark is lit and after, what is the difference?
<!--l. 8053--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Before the spark is lit there is no witness to perceive the
difference. The person may be conscious, but is not aware of being
conscious. It is completely identified with what it thinks and feels and
experiences. The darkness that is in it is of its own creation. When the
darkness is questioned, it dissolves. The desire to question is
planted by the Guru. In other words, the difference between the
person and the witness is as between not knowing and knowing
oneself.
<!--l. 8055--><p class="noindent" >The world seen in consciousness is to be of the nature of consciousness,
when there is harmony ( sattva); but when activity and passivity (
rajas and tamas) appear, they obscure and distort and you see the false
as real.
<!--l. 8057--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What can the person do to prepare itself for the coming of the
Guru.
<!--l. 8059--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The very desire to be ready means that the Guru had come and the
flame is lighted. It may be a stray word, or a page in a book; the
Guru&#8217;s grace works mysteriously.
<!--l. 8061--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no such thing as self-preparation? We hear so much about
yoga sadhana?

<!--l. 8063--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not the person that is doing sadhana. The person is in
unrest and resistance to the very end. It is the witness that works
on the person, on the totality of its illusions, past, present and
future.
<!--l. 8065--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can we know that what you say is true? While it is self
contained and free from inner contradictions, how can we know that it
is not a product of fertile imagination, nurtured and enriched by
constant repetition?
<!--l. 8067--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The proof of the truth lies in its effect on the listener.
<!--l. 8069--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Words can have a most powerful effect. By hearing, or repeating
words, one can experience various kinds of trances. The listener&#8217;s
experiences may be induced and cannot be considered as a proof.
<!--l. 8071--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The effect need not necessarily be an experience. It can be a change
in character, in motivation, in relationship to people and one&#8217;s self.
Trances and visions induced by words, or drugs, or any other sensory
or mental means are temporary and inconclusive. The truth of
what is said here is immovable and everlasting. And the proof of
it is in the listener, in the deep and permanent changes in his
entire being. It is not something he can doubt, unless he doubts
his own existence, which is unthinkable. When my experience
becomes your own experience also, what better proof do you
want?
<!--l. 8073--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The experiencer is the proof of his experience.
<!--l. 8075--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite, but the experiencer needs no proof. &#8216;I am, and I know I am&#8217;.
You cannot ask for further proofs.
<!--l. 8077--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can there be true knowledge of things?

<!--l. 8079--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Relatively &#8211; yes. Absolutely &#8211; there are no things. To know that
nothing is is true knowledge.
<!--l. 8081--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the link between the relative and the absolute?
<!--l. 8083--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They are identical.
<!--l. 8085--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>From which point of view are they identical?
<!--l. 8087--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When the words are spoken, there is silence. When the relative is
over, the absolute remains.
<!--l. 8089--><p class="noindent" >The silence before the words were spoken, is it different from the silence
that comes after? The silence is one and without it the words could not
have been heard. It is always there &#8211; at the back of the words. Shift
your attention from words to silence and you will hear it. The mind
craves for experience, the memory of which it takes for knowledge. The
jnani is beyond all experience and his memory is empty of the past. He
is entirely unrelated to anything in particular. But the mind
craves for formulations and definitions, always eager to squeeze
reality into a verbal shape. Of everything it wants an idea, for
without ideas the mind is not. Reality is essentially alone, but
the mind will not leave it alone &#8211; and deals instead with the
unreal. And yet it is all the mind can do &#8211; discover the unreal as
unreal.
<!--l. 8091--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And seeing the real as real?
<!--l. 8093--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no such state as seeing the real. Who is to see what? You
can only be the real &#8211; which you are, anyhow. The problem is only
mental. Abandon false ideas, that is all. There is no need of true ideas.
There aren&#8217;t any.
<!--l. 8095--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why then are we encouraged to seek the real?

<!--l. 8097--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind must have a purpose. To encourage it to free itself from
the unreal it is promised something in return. In reality, there is no
need of purpose. Being free from the false is good in itself, it
wants no reward. It is just like being clean &#8211; which is its own
reward.
<!--l. 8099--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not self-knowledge the reward?
<!--l. 8101--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The reward of self-knowledge is freedom from the personal self. You
cannot know the knower, for you are the knower. The fact of knowing
proves the knower. You need no other proof. The knower of the known
is not knowable. Just like the light is known in colours only, so is the
knower known in knowledge.
<!--l. 8103--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is the knower an inference only?
<!--l. 8105--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You know your body, mind and feelings. Are you an inference
only?
<!--l. 8107--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am an inference to others. but not to myself.
<!--l. 8109--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So am I. An inference to you, but not to myself. I know myself by
being myself. As you know yourself to be a man by being one. You do
not keep on reminding yourself that you are a man. It is only when
your humanity is questioned that you assert it. Similarly, I know
that I am all. I do not need to keep on repeating: &#8216;I am all, I
am all&#8217;. Only when you take me to be a particular, a person, I
protest. As you are a man all the time, so I am what I am &#8211; all the
time. Whatever you are changelessly, that you are beyond all
doubt.
<!--l. 8111--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I ask how do you know that you are a jnani, you answer: &#8216;I
find no desire in me. Is this not a proof?&#8217;

<!--l. 8113--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Were I full of desires, I would have still been what I am.
<!--l. 8115--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Myself, full of desires and you, full of desires; what difference would
there be?
<!--l. 8117--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You identify yourself with your desires and become their slave. To
me desires are things among other things, mere clouds in the mental
sky, and I do not feel compelled to act on them.
<!--l. 8119--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The knower and his knowledge, are they one or two?
<!--l. 8121--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They are both. The knower is the unmanifested, the known is the
manifested. The known is always on the move, it changes, it has no
shape of its own, no dwelling place. The knower is the immutable
support of all knowledge; Each needs the other, but reality lies
beyond. The jnani cannot be known, because there is nobody to be
known. When there is a person, you can tell something about
it, but when there is no self-identification with the particular,
what can be said? You may tell a jnani anything; his question
will always be: &#8216;about whom are you talking? There is no such
person&#8217;.
<!--l. 8123--><p class="noindent" >Just as you cannot say anything about the universe because
it includes everything, so nothing can be said about a jnani,
for he is all and yet nothing in particular. You need a hook to
hang your picture on; when there is no hook, on what will the
picture hang? To locate a thing you need space, to place an
event you need time; but the timeless and spaceless defies all
handling. It makes everything perceivable, yet itself it is beyond
perception. The mind cannot know what is beyond the mind, but the
mind is known by what is beyond it. The jnani knows neither
birth nor death; existence and non-existence are the same to
him.

<!--l. 8125--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When your body dies, you remain.
<!--l. 8127--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing dies. The body is just imagined. There is no such
thing.
<!--l. 8129--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Before another century will pass, you will be dead to all around
you. Your body will be covered with flowers, then burnt and
the ashes scattered. That will be our experience. What will be
yours?
<!--l. 8131--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Time will come to an end. This is called the Great Death (
mahamrityu), the death of time.
<!--l. 8133--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it mean that the universe and its contents will come to an
end?
<!--l. 8135--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The universe is your personal experience. How can it be affected?
You might have been delivering a lecture for two hours; where has it
gone when it is over? It has merged into silence in which the beginning,
middle and end of the lecture are all together. Time has come to a
stop, it was, but is no more. The silence after a life of talking and the
silence after a life of silence is the same silence. Immortality is
freedom from the feeling: &#8216;I am&#8217;. Yet it is not extinction. On
the contrary, it is a state infinitely more real, aware and happy
than you can possibly think of. Only self-consciousness is no
more.
<!--l. 8137--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why does the Great Death of the mind coincide with the &#8216;small
death&#8217; of the body?
<!--l. 8139--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It does not! You may die a hundred deaths without a break in the
mental turmoil. Or, you may keep your body and die only in the mind.
The death of the mind is the birth of wisdom.

<!--l. 8141--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The person goes and only the witness remains.
<!--l. 8143--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who remains to say: &#8216;I am the witness&#8217;. When there is no &#8216;I am&#8217;,
where is the witness? In the timeless state there is no self to take refuge
in.
<!--l. 8145--><p class="noindent" >The man who carries a parcel is anxious not to lose it &#8211; he is
parcel-conscious. The man who cherishes the feeling &#8216;I am&#8217; is
self-conscious. The jnani holds on to nothing and cannot be said to be
conscious. And yet he is not unconscious. He is the very heart of
awareness. We call him digambara clothed in space, the Naked
One, beyond all appearance. There is no name and shape under
which he may be said to exist, yet he is the only one that truly
is.
<!--l. 8147--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I cannot grasp it.
<!--l. 8149--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who can? The mind has its limits. It is enough to bring you to the
very frontiers of knowledge and make you face the immensity of the
unknown. To dive in it is up to you.
<!--l. 8151--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What about the witness? Is it real or unreal?
<!--l. 8153--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is both. The last remnant of illusion, the first touch of the real.
To say: I am only the witness is both false and true: false because of
the &#8216;I am&#8217;, true because of the witness. It is better to say: &#8216;there is
witnessing&#8217;. The moment you say: &#8216;I am&#8217;, the entire universe comes into
being along with its creator.
<!--l. 8155--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Another question: can we visualise the person and the self as two
brothers small and big? The little brother is mischievous and selfish,
rude and restless, while the big brother is intelligent and kind,
reasonable and considerate, free from body consciousness with its
desires and fears. The big brother knows the little one. but the small

one is ignorant of the big one and thinks itself to be entirely on its own.
The Guru comes and tells the smaller one: &#8216;You are not alone, you
come from a very good family, your brother is a very remarkable man,
wise and kind, and he loves you very much. Remember him,
think of him, find him, serve him, and you will become one with
him&#8217;. Now, the question is are there two in us, the personal and
the individual, the false self and the true self, or is it only a
simile?
<!--l. 8157--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is both. They appear to be two, but on investigation they are
found to be one. Duality lasts only as long as it is not questioned. The
trinity: mind, self and spirit ( vyakti, vyakta, avyakta), when looked
into, becomes unity. These are only modes of experiencing: of
attachment, of detachment, of transcendence.
<!--l. 8159--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Your assumption that we are in a dream state makes your position
unassailable. Whatever objection we raise, you just deny its validity.
One cannot discuss with you!
<!--l. 8161--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The desire to discuss is also mere desire. The desire to know, to
have the power, even the desire to exist are desires only. Everybody
desires to be, to survive, to continue, for no one is sure of himself. But
everybody is immortal. You make yourself mortal by taking yourself to
be the body.
<!--l. 8163--><p class="noindent" ><span

it?

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why little? Take the whole. Take it, it is there for the taking. But
you are afraid of freedom!
<!--l. 8167--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Swami Ramdas had to deal with a similar request. Some devotees
collected round him one day and began to ask for liberation.
Ramdas listened smilingly and then suddenly he became serious

and said: You can have it, here and now, freedom absolute and
permanent. Who wants it, come forward. Nobody moved. Thrice he
repeated the offer. None accepted. Then he said: &#8216;The offer is
withdrawn&#8217;.
<!--l. 8169--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Attachment destroys courage. The giver is always ready to give.
The taker is absent. Freedom means letting go. People just do not care
to let go everything. They do not know that the finite is the price of
the infinite, as death is the price of immortality. Spiritual maturity lies
in the readiness to let go everything. The giving up is the first
step. But the real giving up is in realising that there is nothing
to give up, for nothing is your own. It is like deep sleep &#8211; you
do not give up your bed when you fall sleep &#8211; you just forget
it.

 id="x1-7900074"></a>Truth is Here and Now</h2>
<!--l. 8173--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>My question is: What is the proof of truth? Followers of
every religion, metaphysical or political, philosophical or ethical, are
convinced that theirs is the only truth, that all else is false and they
take their own unshakable conviction for the proof of truth. &#8216;I am
convinced, so it must be true&#8217;, they say. It seems to me, that no
philosophy or religion, no doctrine or ideology, however complete, free
from inner contradictions and emotionally appealing, can be
the proof of its own truth. They are like clothes men put on,
which vary with times and circumstances and follow the fashion
trends.
<!--l. 8175--><p class="noindent" >Now, can there be a religion or philosophy which is true and which
does not depend on somebody&#8217;s conviction? Nor on scriptures,
because they again depend on somebody&#8217;s faith in them? Is
there a truth which does not depend on trusting, which is not
subjective?
<!--l. 8177--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>What about science?
<!--l. 8179--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Science is circular, it ends where it starts, with the senses. It deals
with experience, and experience is subjective. No two persons can have
the same experience, though they may express it in the same
words.
<!--l. 8181--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You must look for truth beyond the mind.
<!--l. 8183--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, I have had enough of trances. Any drug can induce them
cheaply and quickly. Even the classical samadhis, caused by breathing
or mental exercises, are not much different. There are oxygen samadhis
and carbon dioxide samadhis and self induced samadhis, caused
by repetition of a formula or a chain of thoughts. Monotony is
soporific. I cannot accept samadhi, however glorious, as a proof of

truth.
<!--l. 8185--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Samadhi is beyond experience. It is a qualityless state.
<!--l. 8187--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The absence of experience is due to inattention. It reappears with
attention. Closing one&#8217;s eyes does not disprove light. Attributing reality
to negative states will not take us far. The very negation contains an
affirmation.
<!--l. 8189--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In a way you are right. But don&#8217;t you see, you are asking for the
proof of truth, without explaining what is the truth you have in mind
and what proof will satisfy you? You can prove anything, provided you
trust your proof. But what will prove that your proof is true?
I can easily drive you into an admission that you know only
that you exist &#8211; that you are the only proof you can have of
anything.
<!--l. 8191--><p class="noindent" >But I do not identify mere existence with reality. Existence is
momentary, always in time and space, while reality is changeless and
all-pervading.
<!--l. 8193--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, I do not know what is truth and what can prove it. Do not
throw me on my own resources. I have none. Here you are the
truth-knower, not me.
<!--l. 8195--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You refuse testimony as the proof of truth: the experience of others
is of no use to you, you reject all inference from the concurring
statements of a vast number of independent witnesses; so it is for you
to tell me what is the proof that will satisfy you, what is your test of a
valid proof?
<!--l. 8197--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Honestly, I do not know what makes a proof.
<!--l. 8199--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not even your own experience?

<!--l. 8201--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Neither my experience, nor even existence. They depend on my
being conscious.
<!--l. 8203--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>And your being conscious depends on what?
<!--l. 8205--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do not know. Formerly, I would have said: on my body; now I can
see that the body is secondary, not primary, and cannot be considered
as an evidence of existence.
<!--l. 8207--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am glad you have abandoned the l-am-the-body idea, the main
source of error and suffering.
<!--l. 8209--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have abandoned it intellectually, but the sense of being
the particular, a person, is still with me. I can say: &#8216;I am&#8217;, but
what I am I cannot say. I know I exist, but I do not know what
exists.
<!--l. 8211--><p class="noindent" >Whichever way I put it, I face the unknown.
<!--l. 8213--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your very being is the real.
<!--l. 8215--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, we are not talking of the same thing. I am not some abstract
being. I am a person, limited and aware of its limitations. I am a fact,
but a most unsubstantial fact I am. There is nothing I can build on my
momentary existence as a person.
<!--l. 8217--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your words are wiser than you are! As a person, your existence is
momentary. But are you a person only? Are you a person at
all?
<!--l. 8219--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to answer? My sense of being proves only that I am; it
does not prove anything which is independent of me. I am relative,
both creature and creator of the relative. The absolute proof of the
absolute truth &#8211; what is it, where is it? Can the mere feeling &#8216;I am&#8217; be

the proof of reality?
<!--l. 8221--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course not. &#8216;I am&#8217; and &#8216;the world is&#8217; are related and conditional.
They are due to the tendency of the mind to project names and
shapes.
<!--l. 8223--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Names and shapes and ideas and convictions, but not truth. But for
you, I would have accepted the relativity of everything, including
truth, and learnt to live by assumptions. But then I meet you
and hear you talking of the Absolute as within my reach and
also as supremely desirable. Words like peace, bliss, eternity,
immortality, catch my attention, as offering freedom from pain and
fear.
<!--l. 8225--><p class="noindent" >My inborn instincts: pleasure seeking and curiosity are roused and I
begin to explore the realm you have opened. All seems most attractive
and naturally I ask. Is it attainable? Is it real?
<!--l. 8227--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are like a child that says: Prove that the sugar is sweet then
only I shall have it. The proof of the sweetness is in the mouth not in
the sugar. To know it is sweet, you must taste it, there is no other way.
Of course, you begin by asking: Is it sugar? Is it sweet? and you
accept my assurance until you taste it. Then only all doubts
dissolve and your knowledge becomes first hand and unshakable. I
do not ask you to believe me. Just trust me enough to begin
with. Every step proves or disproves itself. You seem to want the
proof of truth to precede truth. And what will be the proof of
the proof? You see, you are falling into a regress. To cut it you
must put a stop to asking for proofs and accept, for a moment
only, something as true. It does not really matter what it is. It
may be God, or me, or your own self. In each case you accept
something, or somebody, unknown as true. Now, if you act on
the truth you have accepted, even for a moment, very soon you
will be brought to the next step. It is like climbing a tree in the

dark &#8211; you can get hold of the next branch only when you are
perched on the previous one. In science it is called the experimental
approach.
<!--l. 8229--><p class="noindent" >To prove a theory you carry out an experiment according to the
operational instructions, left by those who have made the experiment
before you. In spiritual search the chain of experiments one has to
make is called Yoga.
<!--l. 8231--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There are so many Yogas, which to choose?
<!--l. 8233--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course, every jnani will suggest the path of his own attainment
as the one he knows most intimately. But most of them are very liberal
and adapt their advice to the needs of the enquirer. All the paths take
you to the purification of the mind. The impure mind is opaque to
truth; the pure mind is transparent. Truth can be seen through it easily
and clearly.
<!--l. 8235--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am sorry, but I seem unable to convey my difficulty. I and asking
about the proof of truth and am being given the methods of
attaining it. Assuming I follow the methods and attain some most
wonderful and desirable state, how do I come to know that my
state is true? Every religion begins with faith and promises some
ecstasy. Is the ecstasy of the real, or the product of faith? For, if it
is an induced state, I shall have nothing to do with it. Take
Christianity that says: Jesus is your Saviour, believe and be
saved from sin. When I ask a sinning Christian how is it that he
has not been saved from sin in spite of his faith in Christ, he
answers: My faith is not perfect. Again we are in the vicious
circle &#8211; without perfect faith &#8211; no salvation, without salvation &#8211;
no perfect faith, hence no salvation. Conditions are imposed
which are unfulfillable and then we are blamed for not fulfilling
them.

<!--l. 8237--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You do not realise that your present waking state is one of
ignorance. Your question about the proof of truth is born from
ignorance of reality. You are contacting your sensory and mental states
in consciousness, at the point of &#8216;I am&#8217;, while reality is not mediated,
not contacted, not experienced.
<!--l. 8239--><p class="noindent" >You are taking duality so much for granted, that you do not even
notice it, while to me variety and diversity do not create separation.
You imagine reality to stand apart from names and forms, while to me
names and forms are the ever changing expressions of reality and not
apart from it. You ask for the proof of truth while to me all existence is
the proof. You separate existence from being and being from reality,
while to me it is all one. However much you are convinced of the truth
of your waking state, you do not claim it to be permanent and
changeless, as I do when I talk of mine. Yet I see no difference
between us, except that you are imagining things, while I do
not.
<!--l. 8241--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>First you disqualify me from asking about truth, then you
accuse me of imagination! What is imagination to you is reality to
me.
<!--l. 8243--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Until you investigate. I am not accusing you of anything. I am only
asking you to question wisely. Instead of searching for the proof of
truth, which you do not know, go through the proofs you have of what
you believe to know. You will find you know nothing for sure &#8211; you
trust on hearsay.
<!--l. 8245--><p class="noindent" >To know the truth, you must pass through your own experience.
<!--l. 8247--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am mortally afraid of samadhis and other trances, whatever their
cause. A drink, a smoke, a fever, a drug, breathing, singing, shaking,
dancing, whirling, praying, sex or fasting, mantras or some vertiginous
abstraction can dislodge me from my waking state and give me some

experience, extraordinary because unfamiliar. But when the cause
ceases, the effect dissolves and only a memory remains, haunting but
fading.
<!--l. 8249--><p class="noindent" >Let us give up all means and their results, for the results are
bound by the means; let us put the question anew; can truth be
found?
<!--l. 8251--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Where is the dwelling place of truth where you could go in search
of it? And how will you know that you have found it? What touchstone
do you bring with you to test it? You are back at your initial question:
What is the proof of truth? There must be something wrong with the
question itself, for you tend to repeat it again and again. Why do you
ask what are the proofs of truth? Is it not because you do not know
truth first hand and you are afraid that you may be deceived? You
imagine that truth is a thing which carries the name &#8216;truth&#8217;
and that it is advantageous to have it, provided it is genuine.
Hence your fear of being cheated. You are shopping for truth, but
you do not trust the merchants. You are afraid of forgeries and
imitations.
<!--l. 8253--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am not afraid of being cheated. I am afraid of cheating
myself.
<!--l. 8255--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But you are cheating yourself in your ignorance of your true
motives. You are asking for truth, but in fact you merely seek comfort,
which you want to last for ever. Now, nothing, no state of mind, can
last for ever. In time and space there is always a limit, because
time and space themselves are limited. And in the timeless the
words &#8216;for ever&#8217; have no meaning. The same with the &#8216;proof of
truth&#8217;.
<!--l. 8257--><p class="noindent" >In the realm of non-duality everything is complete, its own proof,
meaning and purpose. Where all is one, no supports are needed. You

imagine that permanence is the proof of truth, that what lasts longer is
somehow more true. Time becomes the measure of truth. And since
time is in the mind, the mind becomes the arbiter and searches within
itself for the proof of truth &#8211; a task altogether impossible and
hopeless!
<!--l. 8259--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, were you to say: Nothing is true, all is relative, I would agree
with you. But you maintain there is truth, reality, perfect knowledge,
therefore I ask: What is it and how do you know? And what will make
me say: Yes, Maharaj was right?
<!--l. 8261--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are holding on to the need for a proof, a testimony, an
authority. You still imagine that truth needs pointing at and telling
you: &#8216;Look, here is truth&#8217;. It is not so. Truth is not the result of an
effort, the end of a road. It is here and now, in the very longing and the
search for it. It is nearer than the mind and the body, nearer than the
sense &#8216;I am&#8217;. You do not see it because you look too far away from
yourself, outside your innermost being. You have objectified truth and
insist on your standard proofs and tests, which apply only to things
and thoughts.
<!--l. 8263--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All I can make out from what you say is that truth is beyond me
and I am not qualified to talk about it.
<!--l. 8265--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are not only qualified, but you are truth itself. Only you
mistake the false for the true.
<!--l. 8267--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You seem to say: Don&#8217;t ask for proofs of truth. Concern yourself
with untruth only.
<!--l. 8269--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The discovery of truth is in the discernment of the false. You can
know what is not. What is &#8211;
<!--l. 8271--><p class="noindent" >you can only be. Knowledge is relative to the known. In a way it is the

counterpart of ignorance.
<!--l. 8273--><p class="noindent" >Where ignorance is not, where is the need of knowledge? By themselves
neither ignorance nor knowledge have being. They are only states of
mind, which again is but an appearance of movement in consciousness
which is in its essence immutable.
<!--l. 8275--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is truth within the realm of the mind or beyond?
<!--l. 8277--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is neither, it is both. It cannot be put into words.
<!--l. 8279--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This is what I hear all the time &#8211; inexpressible ( anirvachaniya). It
does not make me wiser.
<!--l. 8281--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is true that it often covers sheer ignorance. The mind can
operate with terms of its own making, it just cannot go beyond itself.
That which is neither sensory nor mental, and yet without which
neither sensory nor the mental can exist, cannot be contained in them.
Do understand that the mind has its limits; to go beyond, you must
consent to silence.
<!--l. 8283--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can we say that action is the proof of truth? It may not be
verbalised, but it may be demonstrated.
<!--l. 8285--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither action nor inaction. It is beyond both.
<!--l. 8287--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can a man ever say: &#8216;Yes, this is true&#8217;? Or is he limited to the
denial of the false? In other words, is truth pure negation? Or, does a
moment come when it becomes assertion?
<!--l. 8289--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Truth cannot be described, but it can be experienced.
<!--l. 8291--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Experience is subjective, it cannot be shared. Your experiences
leaves me where I am.

<!--l. 8293--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Truth can be experienced, but it is not mere experience. I know it
and I can convey it, but only if you are open to it. To be open means to
want nothing else.
<!--l. 8295--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am full of desires and fears. Does it mean that I am not eligible for
truth?
<!--l. 8297--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Truth is not a reward for good behaviour, nor a prize for passing
some tests. It cannot be brought about. It is the primary, the unborn,
the ancient source of all that is. You are eligible because you are. You
need not merit truth. It is your own. Just stop running away by
running after.
<!--l. 8299--><p class="noindent" >Stand still, be quiet.
<!--l. 8301--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, if you want the body to be still and the mind &#8211; quiet, tell me
how it is done. In self-awareness I see the body and the mind moved by
causes beyond my control. Heredity and environment dominate
me absolutely. The mighty &#8216;I am&#8217;, the creator of the universe,
can be wiped out by a drug temporarily, or a drop of poison &#8211;
permanently.
<!--l. 8303--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again, you take yourself to be the body.
<!--l. 8305--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even if I dismiss this body of bones, flesh and blood as not-me,
still I remain with the subtle body made up of thoughts and
feelings, memories and imaginations. If I dismiss these also as
not-me, I still remain with consciousness, which also is a kind of
body.
<!--l. 8307--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are quite right, but you need not stop there. Go beyond.
Neither consciousness, nor the &#8216;I am&#8217; at the centre of it are you. Your
true being is entirely un-self-conscious, completely free from
all self-identification with whatever it may be, gross, subtle or

transcendental.
<!--l. 8309--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can imagine myself to be beyond. But what proof have l? To be, I
must be somebody.
<!--l. 8311--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is the other way round. To be, you must be nobody. To think
yourself to be something, or somebody, is death and hell.
<!--l. 8313--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have read that in ancient Egypt people were admitted to some
mysteries where, under the influence of drugs or incantations, they
would be expelled from their bodies and could actually experience
standing outside and looking at their own prostrate forms. This was
intended to convince them of the reality of the after-death existence
and create in them a deep concern with their ultimate destiny, so
profitable to the state and temple. The self-identification with the
person owning the body remained.
<!--l. 8315--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The body is made of food, as the mind is made of thoughts. See
them as they are. Non-identification, when natural and spontaneous, is
liberation. You need not know what you are.
<!--l. 8317--><p class="noindent" >Enough to know what you are not. What you are you will never know,
for every discovery reveals new dimensions to conquer. The unknown
has no limits.
<!--l. 8319--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it imply ignorance for ever?
<!--l. 8321--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It means that ignorance never was. Truth is in the discovery not in
the discovered. And to discovery there is no beginning and no end.
Question the limits, go beyond, set yourself tasks apparently impossible
&#8211; this is the way.

What is he indispensable for? A mother is indispensable for giving the

it with the Guru? Is his role also limited, and if so, to what? Or is he
indispensable generally, even absolutely?
<!--l. 8327--><p class="noindent" ><span

shows the way. There are people who believe that without a Guru Yoga
is inaccessible. They are ever in search of the right Guru, changing one
for another. Of what value are such Gurus?
<!--l. 8331--><p class="noindent" ><span

no blame attached to it.

is helpless. The inner Guru bids his chance. Obtuseness and wrong

rude.

destroying the obtuse or perverted personality. Suffering and death, as
life and happiness, are his tools of work. It is only in duality that
non-violence becomes the unifying law.
<!--l. 8355--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Has one to be afraid of his own self?
<!--l. 8357--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not afraid, for the self means well.. But it must be taken
seriously. It calls for attention and obedience; when it is not
listened to, it turns from persuasion to compulsion, for while it
can wait, it shall not be denied. The difficulty lies not with the
Guru, inner or outer. The Guru is always available. It is the ripe
disciple that is lacking. When a person is not ready, what can be
done?

<!--l. 8359--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Ready or willing?
<!--l. 8361--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Both. It comes to the same. In India we call it adhikari. It means
both capable and entitled.
<!--l. 8363--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can the outer Guru grant initiation ( diksha)?
<!--l. 8365--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He can give all kinds of initiations, but the initiation into Reality
must come from within.
<!--l. 8367--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who gives the ultimate initiation?
<!--l. 8369--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is self-given.
<!--l. 8371--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I feel we are running in circles. After all, I know one self only, the
present, empirical self. The inner or higher self is but an idea conceived
to explain and encourage. We talk of it as having independent
existence. It hasn&#8217;t.
<!--l. 8373--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The outer self and the inner both are imagined. The obsession of
being an &#8216;I&#8217; needs another obsession with a &#8216;super-l&#8217; to get cured, as
one needs another thorn to remove a thorn, or another poison to
neutralise a poison. All assertion calls for a denial, but this is the first
step only. The next is to go beyond both.
<!--l. 8375--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do understand that the outer Guru is needed to call my attention
to myself and to the urgent need of doing something about myself. I
also understand how helpless he is when it comes to any deep change in
me. But here you bring in the sadguru, the inner Guru, beginningless,
changeless, the root of being, the standing promise, the certain goal. Is
he a concept or a reality?
<!--l. 8377--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He is the only reality. All else is shadow, cast by the body mind (
deha-buddhi) on the face of time. Of course, even a shadow is related

to reality, but by itself it is not real.
<!--l. 8379--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am the only reality I know. The sadguru is there as long as I think
of him. What do I gain by shifting reality to him?
<!--l. 8381--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your loss is your gain. When the shadow is seen to be a shadow
only, you stop following it. You turn round and discover the sun which
was there all the time &#8211; behind your back!
<!--l. 8383--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does the inner Guru also teach?
<!--l. 8385--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He grants the conviction that you are the eternal, changeless,
reality-consciousness-love, within and beyond all appearances.
<!--l. 8387--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A conviction is not enough. There must be certainty.
<!--l. 8389--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite right. But in this case certainty takes the shape of
courage. Fear ceases absolutely. This state of fearlessness is so
unmistakably new, yet felt deeply as one&#8217;s own, that it cannot be
denied.
<!--l. 8391--><p class="noindent" >It is like loving one&#8217;s own child. Who can doubt it?

<!--l. 8399--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 8401--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The mind is so absolutely restless. For quieting it what is the
way?

<!--l. 8403--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Trust the teacher. Take my own case. My Guru ordered me to
attend to the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; and to give attention to nothing else. I just
obeyed. I did not follow any particular course of breathing, or
meditation, or study of scriptures. Whatever happened, I would turn
away my attention from it and remain with the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;, it may
look too simple, even crude. My only reason for doing it was that my
Guru told me so. Yet it worked! Obedience is a powerful solvent of all
desires and fears.
<!--l. 8405--><p class="noindent" >Just turn away from all that occupies the mind; do whatever work you
have to complete, but avoid new obligations; keep empty, keep
available, resist not what comes uninvited.
<!--l. 8407--><p class="noindent" >In the end you reach a state of non-grasping, of joyful non-attachment,
of inner ease and freedom indescribable, yet wonderfully real.
<!--l. 8409--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When a truth-seeker earnestly practices his Yogas, does his inner
Guru guide and help him or does he leave him to his own resources,
just waiting for the outcome?
<!--l. 8411--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All happens by itself. Neither the seeker. nor the Guru do anything.
Things happen as they happen; blame or praise are apportioned later,
after the sense of doership appearing.
<!--l. 8413--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How strange! Surely the doer comes before the deed.
<!--l. 8415--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is the other way round; the deed is a fact, the doer a mere
concept. Your very language shows that while the deed is certain, the
doer is dubious; shifting responsibility is a game peculiarly human.
Considering the endless list of factors required for anything to happen,
one can only admit that everything is responsible for everything,
however remote. Doership is a myth born from the illusion of &#8216;me&#8217; and
&#8216;the mine&#8217;.

<!--l. 8417--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How powerful the illusion?
<!--l. 8419--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No doubt, because based on reality.
<!--l. 8421--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is real in it?
<!--l. 8423--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Find out, by discerning and rejecting all that is unreal.
<!--l. 8425--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have not understood well the role of the inner self in spiritual
endeavour. Who makes the effort? Is it the outer self, or the
inner?
<!--l. 8427--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have invented words like effort, inner, outer, self, etc. and seek
to impose them on reality.
<!--l. 8429--><p class="noindent" >Things just happen to be as they are, but we want to build them into a
pattern, laid down by the structure of our language. So strong is this
habit, that we tend to deny reality to what cannot be verbalised. We
just refuse to see that words are mere symbols, related by convention
and habit to repeated experiences.
<!--l. 8431--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the value of spiritual books?
<!--l. 8433--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They help in dispelling ignorance. They are useful in the beginning,
but become a hindrance in the end. One must know when to discard
them.
<!--l. 8435--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the link between atma and sattva, between the self and the
universal harmony?
<!--l. 8437--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As between the sun and its rays. Harmony and beauty, understanding
and affection are all expressions of reality. It is reality in action, the
impact of the spirit on matter. Tamas obscures, rajas distorts, sattva
harmonises. With the maturing of the sattva all desires and fears come

to an end.
<!--l. 8439--><p class="noindent" >The real being is reflected in the mind undistorted. Matter is
redeemed, spirit &#8211; revealed. The two are seen as one. They were
always one, but the imperfect mind saw them as two. Perfection of
the mind is the human task, for matter and spirit meet in the
mind.
<!--l. 8441--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I feel like a man before a door. I know the door is open but it is
guarded by the dogs of desire and fear. What am I to do?
<!--l. 8443--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Obey the teacher and brave the dogs. Behave as if they were not
there. Again, obedience is the golden rule. Freedom is won by
obedience. To escape from prison one must unquestioningly obey
instructions sent by those who work for one&#8217;s release.
<!--l. 8445--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The words of the Guru, when merely heard, have little power. One
must have faith to obey them. What creates such faith?
<!--l. 8447--><p class="noindent" ><span

Guru is always ready to share, but there are no takers.
<!--l. 8449--><p class="noindent" ><span

where are the disciples?

through, not a single soul ( jiva) shall be lost.

be their effect on the reader?

<!--l. 8457--><p class="noindent" ><span

flowers and fruits. Words based on truth, if fully tested, have their own

deepen, until they become spontaneous and limitless.
<!--l. 8495--><p class="noindent" ><span

operates within the limitations of physical existence. How can it give
birth to the unlimited?

<!--l. 8501--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Wrong ideas and desires leading to wrong actions, causing

abandonment of the false remove what prevents the real entering the
mind.

<!--l. 8503--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can distinguish two states of mind: &#8216;I am&#8217; and &#8216;the world is&#8217;; they

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The timeless knows the time, the time does not know the timeless.
All consciousness is in time and to it the timeless appears unconscious.
Yet, it is what makes consciousness possible. Light shines in
darkness. In light darkness is not visible. Or, you can put it the
other way &#8211; in the endless ocean of light, clouds of consciousness
appear &#8211; dark and limited, perceivable by contrast. These are mere
attempts to express in words something very simple, yet altogether
inexpressible.

<!--l. 8515--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Word refers to a state of mind, not to reality. The river, the two
banks, the bridge across &#8211; these are all in the mind. Words alone

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is nothing in the world that you cannot know, when you
know yourself. Thinking yourself to be the body you know the world as
a collection of material things. When you know yourself as a centre of
consciousness, the world appears as the ocean of the mind. When
you know yourself as you are in reality, you know the world as
yourself.
<!--l. 8531--><p class="noindent" ><span

is there so much suffering in the world?
<!--l. 8533--><p class="noindent" ><span

the world as a show. a most entertaining show indeed.

by a spectacle of suffering! What a cruel God are you offering
me!
<!--l. 8537--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The cause of suffering is in the identification of the perceiver with
the perceived. Out of it desire is born and with desire blind action,
unmindful of results. Look round and you will see &#8211; suffering is a
man-made thing.
<!--l. 8539--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Were a man to create his own sorrow only, I would agree

others?
<!--l. 8541--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Descriptions are many and contradictory. Reality is simple &#8211; all is
one, harmony is the eternal law, none compels to suffer. It is
only when you try to describe and explain, that the words fail
you.
<!--l. 8543--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I remember Gandhiji telling me once that the Self is not
bound by the law of non-violence ( ahimsa). The Self has the
freedom to impose suffering on its expressions in order to set them
right.
<!--l. 8545--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On the level of duality it may be so, but in reality there is only the
source, dark in itself, making everything shine. Unperceived, it causes
perception. Unfelt, it causes feeling. Unthinkable, it causes thought.
Non-being, it gives birth to being. It is the immovable background of
motion. Once you are there you are at home everywhere.
<!--l. 8547--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I am that, then what causes me to be born?
<!--l. 8549--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The memory of the past unfulfilled desires traps energy, which
manifests itself as a person.

<!--l. 8551--><p class="noindent" >When its charge gets exhausted, the person dies. Unfulfilled desires are
carried over into the next birth. Self-identification with the body
creates ever fresh desires and there is no end to them, unless
this mechanism of bondage is clearly seen. It is clarity that is
liberating, for you cannot abandon desire, unless its causes and effects
are clearly seen. I do not say that the same person is reborn.
It dies and dies for good. But its memories remain and their
desires and fears. They supply the energy for a new person. The
real takes no part in it, but makes it possible by giving it, the
light.
<!--l. 8553--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My difficulty is this. As I can see, every experience is its own reality.
It is there &#8211; experienced.
<!--l. 8555--><p class="noindent" >The moment I question it and ask to whom it happens, who
is the observer and so on, the experience is over and all I can
investigate is only the memory of it. I just cannot investigate the
living moment &#8211; the now. My awareness is of the past, not of
the present. When I am aware, I do not really live in the now,
but only in the past. Can there really be an awareness of the
present?
<!--l. 8557--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What you are describing is not awareness at all, but only thinking
about the experience. True awareness ( samvid) is a state of pure
witnessing, without the least attempt to do anything about the event
witnessed. Your thoughts and feelings, words and actions may also be a
part of the event; you watch all unconcerned in the full light of
clarity and understanding. You understand precisely what is
going on, because it does not affect you. It may seem to be an
attitude of cold aloofness, but it is not really so. Once you are in it,
you will find that you love what you see, whatever may be its
nature. This choiceless love is the touchstone of awareness. If
it is not there, you are merely interested &#8211; for some personal
reasons.

<!--l. 8559--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As long as there are pain and pleasure, one is bound to be
interested.
<!--l. 8561--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>And as long as one is conscious, there will be pain and pleasure.
You cannot fight pain and pleasure on the level of consciousness. To go
beyond them you must go beyond consciousness, which is possible only
when you look at consciousness as something that happens to you and
not in you, as something external, alien, superimposed. Then, suddenly
you are free of consciousness, really alone, with nothing to intrude. And
that is your true state. Consciousness is an itching rash that makes you
scratch. Of course, you cannot step out of consciousness for the
very idea of stepping out is in consciousness. But if you learn
to look at your consciousness as a sort of fever, personal and
private, in which you are enclosed like a chick in its shell, out
of this very attitude will come the crisis which will break the
shell.

<!--l. 8569--><p class="noindent" ><span

of death. On the other hand, to him who knows himself truly, death is
a happy event.
<!--l. 8571--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The Hindu tradition says that suffering is brought by destiny and
destiny is merited. Look at the immense calamities, natural or
man-made, floods and earthquakes, wars and revolutions. Can we dare
to think that each suffers for his own sins, of which he can have
no idea? The billions who suffer, are they all criminals justly
punished?

<!--l. 8573--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Must one suffer only for one&#8217;s own sins? Are we really separate? In
this vast ocean of life we suffer for the sins of others, and make others
suffer for our sins. Of course, the law of balance rules Supreme and
accounts are squared in the end. But while life lasts, we affect each
other deeply.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, as the poet says: &#8216;No man is an island&#8217;.
<!--l. 8577--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>At the back of every experience is the Self and its interest in the
experience. Call it desire, call it love &#8211; words do not matter.
<!--l. 8579--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can I desire suffering? Can I deliberately ask for pain? Am I not
like a man who made for himself a downy bed hoping for a good night
of sleep and then he is visited by a nightmare and he tosses and
screams in his dream? Surely, it is not the love that produces
nightmares.
<!--l. 8581--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All suffering is caused by selfish isolation, by insularity and
greed. When the cause of suffering is seen and removed, suffering
ceases.
<!--l. 8583--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I may remove my causes of sorrow, but others will be left to
suffer.
<!--l. 8585--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To understand suffering, you must go beyond pain and pleasure.
Your own desires and fears prevent you from understanding and
thereby helping others. In reality there are no others, and by helping
yourself you help everybody else. If you are serious about the sufferings
of mankind, you must perfect the only means of help you have &#8211;
Yourself.
<!--l. 8587--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You keep on saying that I am the creator, preserver and destroyer of
this world, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent. When I ponder over
what you say, I ask myself: &#8216;How is it that there is so much evil in my

world&#8217;.
<!--l. 8589--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no evil, there is no suffering; the joy of living is
paramount. Look, how everything clings to life, how dear the existence
is.
<!--l. 8591--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>On the screen of my mind images follow each other in endless
succession. There is nothing permanent about me.
<!--l. 8593--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Have a better look at yourself. The screen is there &#8211; it does not
change. The light shines steadily. Only the film in between keeps
moving and causes pictures to appear. You may call the film &#8211; destiny (
prarabdha).
<!--l. 8595--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What creates destiny?
<!--l. 8597--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Ignorance is the cause of inevitability.
<!--l. 8599--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Ignorance of what?
<!--l. 8601--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Ignorance of yourself primarily. Also, ignorance of the true nature
of things, of their causes and effects. You look round without
understanding and take appearances for reality. You believe you know
the world and yourself &#8211; but it is only your ignorance that makes you
say: I know. Begin with the admission that you do not know and start
from there.
<!--l. 8603--><p class="noindent" >There is nothing that can help the world more than your putting an
end to ignorance. Then, you need not do anything in particular to help
the world. Your very being is a help, action or no action.
<!--l. 8605--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can ignorance be known? To know ignorance presupposes
knowledge.

<!--l. 8607--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite right. The very admission: &#8216;I am ignorant&#8217; is the dawn of
knowledge. An ignorant man is ignorant of his ignorance. You can say
that ignorance does not exist, for the moment it is seen it is no more.
Therefore, you may call it unconsciousness or blindness. All you
see around and within you is what you do not know and do
not understand, without even knowing that you do not know
and do not understand. To know that you do not know and do
not understand is true knowledge, the knowledge of an humble
heart.
<!--l. 8609--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, Christ said: Blessed are the poor in spirit...
<!--l. 8611--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Put it as you like; the fact is that knowledge is of ignorance only.
You know that you do not know.
<!--l. 8613--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Will ignorance ever end?
<!--l. 8615--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is wrong with not knowing? You need not know all.
Enough to know what you need to know. The rest can look after
itself, without your knowing how it does it. What is important
is that your unconscious does not work against the conscious,
that there is integration on all levels. To know is not so very
important.
<!--l. 8617--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What you say is correct psychologically. But when it comes to
knowing others, knowing the world, my knowing that I do not know
does not help much.
<!--l. 8619--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Once you are inwardly integrated, outer knowledge comes to you
spontaneously. At every moment of your life you know what you need
to know. In the ocean of the universal mind all knowledge is contained;
it is yours on demand. Most of it you may never need to know &#8211; but it
is yours all the same.

<!--l. 8621--><p class="noindent" >As with knowledge, so it is with power.
<!--l. 8623--><p class="noindent" >Whatever you feel needs be done happens unfailingly. No doubt, God
attends to this business of managing the universe; but He is glad to
have some help. When the helper is selfless and intelligent, all the
powers of the universe are for him to command.
<!--l. 8625--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even the blind powers of nature?
<!--l. 8627--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There are no blind powers. Consciousness is power. Be aware of
what needs be done and it will be done. Only keep alert &#8211; and quiet.
Once you reach your destination and Know your real nature, your
existence becomes a blessing to all. You may not know, nor will the
world know, yet the help radiates. There are people in the world
who do more good than all the statesmen and philanthropists
put together. They radiate light and peace with no intention
or knowledge. When others tell them about the miracles they
worked, they also are wonder struck. Yet, taking nothing as their
own, they are neither proud, nor do they crave for reputation.
They are just unable to desire anything for themselves, not even
the joy of helping others knowing that God is good they are at
peace.

<!--l. 8631--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I am very much attached to my family and possessions.
How can I conquer this attachment?
<!--l. 8633--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>This attachment is born along with the sense of &#8216;me&#8217; and
&#8216;mine&#8217;. Find the true meaning of these words and you will be free
of all bondage. You have a mind which is spread in time. One
after another all things happen to you and the memory remains.
There is nothing wrong in it. The problem arises only when the
memory of past pains and pleasures &#8211; which are essential to all
organic life &#8211; remains as a reflex, dominating behaviour. This reflex
takes the shape of &#8216;I&#8217; and uses the body and the mind for its
purposes, which are invariably in search for pleasure or flight from
pain. When you recognise the &#8216;I&#8217; as it is, a bundle of desires and
fears, and the sense of &#8216;mine&#8217;, as embracing all things and people
needed for the purpose of avoiding pain and securing pleasure,
you will see that the &#8216;I&#8217; and the &#8216;mine&#8217; are false ideas, having
no foundation in reality. Created by the mind, they rule their
creator as long as it takes them to be true; when questioned, they
dissolve.
<!--l. 8635--><p class="noindent" >The &#8216;I&#8217; and &#8216;mine&#8217;, having no existence in themselves, need a support
which they find in the body.
<!--l. 8637--><p class="noindent" >The body becomes their point of reference. When you talk of &#8216;my&#8217;
husband and &#8216;my&#8217; children, you mean the body&#8217;s husband and the
body&#8217;s children. Give up the idea of being the body and face the
question: Who am l? At once a process will be set in motion which will
bring back reality, or, rather, will take the mind to reality. Only, you
must not be afraid.
<!--l. 8639--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 8641--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>For reality to be, the ideas of &#8216;me&#8217; and &#8216;mine&#8217; must go. They will go
if you let them. Then your normal natural state reappears, in which
you are neither the body nor the mind, neither the &#8216;me&#8217; nor the &#8216;mine&#8217;,
but in a different state of being altogether. It is pure awareness of
being, without being this or that, without any self-identification with
anything in particular, or in general. In that pure light of consciousness
there is nothing, not even the idea of nothing. There is only
light.
<!--l. 8643--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 8657--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 8665--><p class="noindent" ><span

sleeping. There is enough for all, provided all share.

<!--l. 8673--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This is not the same as voluntary sharing. Society will not change

change.
<!--l. 8675--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 8677--><p class="noindent" ><span

healthy and happy world, which will radiate and communicate, increase
and spread. The power of a true heart is immense.
<!--l. 8679--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Please tell us more.
<!--l. 8681--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Talking is not my hobby. Sometimes I talk, sometimes I do not. My
talking, or not talking, is a part of a given situation and does not
depend on me. When there is a situation in which I have to talk, I hear
myself talking. In some other situation I may not hear myself talking.
It is all the same to me. Whether I talk or not, the light and love of
being what I am are not affected, nor are they under my control.
They are, and I know they are. There is a glad awareness, but
nobody who is glad. Of course, there is a sense of identity, but it is
the identity of a memory track, like the identity of a sequence
of pictures on the ever-present screen. Without the light and
the screen there can be no picture. To know the picture as the

play of light on the screen, gives freedom from the idea that the
picture is real. All you have to do is to understand that you love
the self and the self loves you and that the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; is the
link between you both, a token of identity in spite of apparent
diversity.
<!--l. 8683--><p class="noindent" >Look at the &#8216;I am&#8217; as a sign of love between the inner and the outer,
the real and the appearance.
<!--l. 8685--><p class="noindent" >Just like in a dream all is different, except the sense of &#8216;I&#8217;, which
enables you to say &#8216;I dreamt&#8217;, so does the sense of &#8216;I am&#8217; enable you to
say &#8216;I am my real Self again&#8217;. I do nothing, nor is anything done to me.
I am what I am and nothing can affect me. I appear to depend on
everything, but in fact all depends on me.
<!--l. 8687--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can you say you do nothing? Are you not talking to
me?
<!--l. 8689--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I do not have the feeling that I am talking. There is talking going
on, that is all.
<!--l. 8691--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I talk.
<!--l. 8693--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Do you? You hear yourself talking and you say: I talk.
<!--l. 8695--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Everybody says: &#8216;I work, I come, I go&#8217;.
<!--l. 8697--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I have no objection to the conventions of your language, but they
distort and destroy reality. A more accurate way of saying would have
been: &#8216;There is talking, working, coming, going&#8217;. For anything to
happen, the entire universe must coincide. It is wrong to believe
that anything in particular can cause an event. Every cause is
universal. Your very body would not exist without the entire universe
contributing to its creation and survival. I am fully aware that things

happen as they happen because the world is as it is. To affect the
course of events I must bring a new factor into the world and such
factor can only be myself, the power of love and understanding focussed
in me.
<!--l. 8699--><p class="noindent" >When the body is born, all kinds of things happen to it and you take
part in them, because you take yourself to be the body. You are
like the man in the cinema house, laughing and crying with the
picture, though knowing fully well that he is all the time in his seat
and the picture is but the play of light. It is enough to shift
attention from the screen to oneself to break the spell. When the
body dies, the kind of life you live now &#8211; succession of physical
and mental events &#8211; comes to an end. It can end even now &#8211;
without waiting for the death of the body &#8211; it is enough to shift
attention to the Self and keep it there. All happens as if there is a
mysterious power that creates and moves everything. realise that
you are not the mover, only the observer, and you will be at
peace.
<!--l. 8701--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is that power separate from me?
<!--l. 8703--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course not. But you must begin by being the dispassionate
observer. Then only will you realise your full being as the universal
lover and actor. As long as you are enmeshed in the tribulations of a
particular personality, you can see nothing beyond it. But ultimately
you will come to see that you are neither the particular nor the
universal, you are beyond both. As the tiny point of a pencil can draw
innumerable pictures, so does the dimensionless point of awareness
draw the contents of the vast universe. Find that point and be
free.
<!--l. 8705--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Out of what do I create this world?
<!--l. 8707--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Out of your own memories. As long as you are ignorant of yourself

as the creator, your world is limited and repetitive. Once you go
beyond your self-identification with your past, you are free to create a
new world of harmony and beauty. Or you just remain &#8211; beyond being
and non-being.
<!--l. 8709--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What will remain with me if I let go my memories?
<!--l. 8711--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing will remain.
<!--l. 8713--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am afraid.
<!--l. 8715--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You will be afraid until you experience freedom and its blessings.
Of course, some memories are needed to identify and guide the
body and such memories do remain, but there is no attachment
left to the body as such; it is no longer the ground for desire or
fear. All this is not very difficult to understand and practice,
but you must be interested. Without interest nothing can be
done.
<!--l. 8717--><p class="noindent" >Having seen that you are a bundle of memories held together
by attachment, step out and look from the outside. You may
perceive for the first time something which is not memory. You
cease to be a Mr-so-and-so, busy about his own affairs. You
are at last at peace. You realise that nothing was ever wrong
with the world &#8211; you alone were wrong and now it is all over.
Never again will you be caught in the meshes of desire born of
ignorance.

your realisation?
<!--l. 8722--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Somehow it was very simple and easy in my case. My Guru,
before he died, told me: Believe me, you are the Supreme Reality. Don&#8217;t
doubt my words, don&#8217;t disbelieve me. I am telling you the truth &#8211; act
on it. I could not forget his words and by not forgetting &#8211; I have
realised.
<!--l. 8724--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But what were you actually doing?
<!--l. 8726--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing special. I lived my life, plied my trade, looked after my

fall back on. It was enough.
<!--l. 8728--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 8730--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>His words were true and so they came true. True words always

<!--l. 8734--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Put it as you like. Things happen as they happen &#8211; who can tell

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You made no efforts whatsoever?
<!--l. 8738--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>None. Believe it or not, I was not even anxious to realise. He only
told me that I am the Supreme and then died. I just could not

disbelieve him. The rest happened by itself. I found myself changing &#8211;
that is all. As a matter of fact, I was astonished. But a desire
arose in me to verify his words. I was so sure that he, could not
possibly have told a lie, that I felt I shall either realise the full
meaning of his words or die. I was feeling quite determined, but did
not know what to do. I would spend hours thinking of him and
his assurance, not arguing, but just remembering what he told
me.
<!--l. 8740--><p class="noindent" ><span

Supreme?
<!--l. 8742--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nobody came to tell me. Nor was I told so inwardly. In fact, it was
only in the beginning when I was making efforts, that I was passing
through some strange experiences; seeing lights, hearing voices, meeting
gods and goddesses and conversing with them. Once the Guru told me:
&#8216;You are the Supreme Reality&#8217;, I ceased having visions and trances and
became very quiet and simple. I found myself desiring and knowing less
and less, until I could say in utter astonishment: &#8216;I know nothing, I
want nothing.&#8217;
<!--l. 8744--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 8758--><p class="noindent" ><span

something did happen to you at that date. What happened?
<!--l. 8762--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind ceased producing events. The ancient and ceaseless
search stopped &#8211; l wanted nothing, expected nothing &#8211; accepted
nothing as my own. There was no &#8216;me&#8217; left to strive for. Even the bare
&#8216;I am&#8217; faded away. The other thing that I noticed was that I lost all my
habitual certainties.
<!--l. 8764--><p class="noindent" >Earlier I was sure of so many things, now I am sure of nothing. But I
feel that I have lost nothing by not knowing, because all my knowledge
was false. My not knowing was in itself knowledge of the fact that all
knowledge is ignorance, that &#8216;I do not know&#8217; is the only true
statement the mind can make. Take the idea &#8216;I was born&#8217;. You may
take it to be true. It is not. You were never born, nor will you
ever die. It is the idea that was born and shall die, not you.
By identifying yourself with it you became mortal. Just like
in a cinema all is light, so does consciousness become the vast
world.
<!--l. 8766--><p class="noindent" >Look closely, and you will see that all names and forms are but

moves rapidly and traces shapes, thoughts and feelings, concepts and
ideas, like the pen writing on paper. And the ink that leaves a trace is
memory. You are that tiny point and by your movement the world is
ever recreated. Stop moving, and there will be no world. Look within
and you will find that the point of light is the reflection of the
immensity of light in the body, as the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;. There is only light,
all else appears.

<!--l. 8772--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 8776--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can it be? You have your own private mind, woven with
memories, held together by desires and fears. I have no mind of my
own; what I need to know the universe brings before me, as it supplies
the food I eat.

<!--l. 8784--><p class="noindent" ><span

get from you the knowledge needed at the moment, but you are not
apart from me.

<!--l. 8788--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To be the point of light tracing the world is turiya. To be the light

itself is turiyatita. But of what use are names when reality is so
near?
<!--l. 8790--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there any progress in your condition? When you compare yourself
yesterday with yourself today, do you find yourself changing,
making progress? Does your vision of reality grow in width and
depth?
<!--l. 8792--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Reality is immovable and yet in constant movement. It is like a
mighty river &#8211; it flows and yet it is there &#8211; eternally. What flows is
not the river with its bed and banks, but its water, so does the
sattva guna, the universal harmony, play its games against tamas
and rajas, the forces of darkness and despair. In sattva there is
always change and progress, in rajas there is change and regress,
while tamas stands for chaos. The three Gunas play eternally
against each other &#8211; it is a fact and there can be no quarrel with a
fact.
<!--l. 8794--><p class="noindent" ><span

about sattva?

<!--l. 8804--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Where consciousness does not reach, matter begins. A thing
is a form of being which we have not understood. It does not
change &#8211; it is always the same &#8211; it appears to be there on its own

<!--l. 8806--><p class="noindent" >something strange and alien. Of course it is in the chit, consciousness,
but appears to be outside because of its apparent changelessness. The
foundation of things is in memory &#8211; without memory there would be no

Shiva: this is the eternal process. All things are governed by
it.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What happens then to my consciousness?
<!--l. 8814--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>After the stage of creation, comes the stage of examination and
reflection and, finally, the stage of abandonment and forgetting. The
consciousness remains, but in a latent, quiet state.
<!--l. 8816--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does the state of identity remain?
<!--l. 8818--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The state of identity is inherent in reality and never fades. But
identity is neither the transient personality ( vyakti), nor the
karma-bound individuality ( vyakta). It is what remains when all
self-identification is given up as false &#8211; pure consciousness, the sense of

being all there is, or could be.
<!--l. 8820--><p class="noindent" >Consciousness is pure in the beginning and pure in the end; in between
it gets contaminated by imagination which is at the root of creation. At
all times consciousness remains the same. To know it as it is, is
realisation and timeless peace.
<!--l. 8822--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; real or unreal?
<!--l. 8824--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Both. It is unreal when we say: &#8216;I am this, I am that&#8217;. It is real
when we mean &#8216;I am not this, nor that&#8217;.
<!--l. 8826--><p class="noindent" >The knower comes and goes with the known, and is transient; but that
which knows that it does not know, which is free of memory and

<!--l. 8830--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Without one the other cannot be. Yet they are not one. It is like
the flower and its colour. Without flower &#8211; no colours; without
colour &#8211; the flower remains unseen. Beyond is the light which on
contact with the flower creates the colour. realise that your true
nature is that of pure light only, and both the perceived and the
perceiver come and go together. That which makes both possible,
and yet is neither, is your real being, which means not being a
&#8216;this&#8217; or &#8216;that&#8217;, but pure awareness of being and not-being. When
awareness is turned on itself, the feeling is of not knowing. When it is
turned outward, the knowables come into being. To say: &#8216;I know
myself&#8217; is a contradiction in terms for what is &#8216;known&#8217; cannot be
&#8216;myself&#8217;.
<!--l. 8832--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If the self is for ever the unknown, what then is realised in
self-realisation?

<!--l. 8834--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To know that the known cannot be me nor mine, is liberation
enough. Freedom from self-identification with a set of memories
and habits, the state of wonder at the infinite reaches of the
being, its inexhaustible creativity and total transcendence, the
absolute fearlessness born from the realisation of the illusoriness
and transiency of every mode of consciousness &#8211; flow from a
deep and inexhaustible source. To know the source as source
and appearance as appearance, and oneself as the source only is
self-realisation.
<!--l. 8836--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>On what side is the witness? Is it real or unreal?
<!--l. 8838--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nobody can say: &#8216;I am the witness&#8217;. The &#8216;I am&#8217; is always witnessed.
The state of detached awareness is the witness-consciousness, the
&#8216;mirror-mind&#8217;. It rises and sets with its object and thus it is not quite
the real. Whatever its object, it remains the same, hence it is also real.
It partakes of both the real and the unreal and is therefore a bridge
between the two.
<!--l. 8840--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If all happens only to the &#8216;I am&#8217;, if the &#8216;I am&#8217; is the known and the
knower and the knowledge itself, what does the witness do? Of what
use is it?
<!--l. 8842--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It does nothing and is of no use whatsoever.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then why do we talk of it?
<!--l. 8846--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because it is there. The bridge serves one purpose only &#8211; to cross
over. You don&#8217;t build houses on a bridge. The &#8216;I am&#8217; looks at
things, the witness sees through them. It sees them as they are
&#8211;
<!--l. 8848--><p class="noindent" >unreal and transient. To say &#8216;not me, not mine&#8217; is the task of the
witness.

<!--l. 8860--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>We have a long history of drug-taking behind us, mostly
drugs of the consciousness-expanding variety. They gave us the
experience of other states of consciousness, high and low, and also the
conviction, that drugs are unreliable and, at best, transitory and, at
worst, destructive of organism and personality. We are in search of
better means for developing consciousness and transcendence. We want
the fruits of our search to stay with us and enrich our lives,
instead of turning to pale memories and helpless regrets. If by the
spiritual we mean self-investigation and development, our purpose in
coming to India is definitely spiritual. The happy hippy stage is
behind us; we are serious now and on the move. We know there is
reality to be found, but we do not know how to find and hold
on to it. We need no convincing, only guidance. Can you help
us?
<!--l. 8862--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You do not need help, only advice. What you seek is already
in you. Take my own case. I did nothing for my realisation. My teacher
told me that the reality is within me; I looked within and found it
there, exactly as my teacher told me. To see reality is as simple as to
see one&#8217;s face in a mirror. Only the mirror must be clear and true. A
quiet mind, undistorted by desires and fears, free from ideas and
opinions, clear on all the levels, is needed to reflect the reality. Be clear
and quiet &#8211;
<!--l. 8864--><p class="noindent" >alert and detached, all else will happen by itself.
<!--l. 8866--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You had to make your mind clear and quiet before you could realise
the truth. How did you do it?
<!--l. 8868--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I did nothing. It just happened. I lived my life, attending to my
family&#8217;s needs. Nor did my Guru do it. It just happened, as he said it
will.

<!--l. 8870--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Things do not just happen. There must be a cause for everything.
<!--l. 8872--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All that happens is the cause of all that happens. Causes are
numberless; the idea of a sole cause is an illusion.
<!--l. 8874--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You must have been doing something specific &#8211; some meditation
or Yoga. How can you say that realisation will happen on its
own?
<!--l. 8876--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing specific. I just lived my life.
<!--l. 8878--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am amazed!
<!--l. 8880--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So was I. But what was there to be amazed at? My teacher&#8217;s words
came true. So what? He knew me better than I knew myself, that is all.
Why search for causes? In the very beginning I was giving some
attention and time to the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;, but only in the beginning. Soon
after my Guru died, I lived on. His words proved to be true. That is all.
It is all one process. You tend to separate things in time and then look
for causes.
<!--l. 8882--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is your work now? What are you doing?
<!--l. 8884--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You imagine being and doing as identical. It is not so. The mind
and the body move and change and cause other minds and bodies to
move and change and that is called doing, action. I see that it is in the
nature of action to create further action like fire that continues by
burning. I neither act nor cause others to act; I am timelessly aware of
what is going on.
<!--l. 8886--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In your mind, or also in other minds?
<!--l. 8888--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is only one mind, which swarms with ideas; &#8216;I am this, I am
that, this is mine, that is mine&#8217;.

<!--l. 8894--><p class="noindent" ><span

manifest themselves in many ways.
<!--l. 8896--><p class="noindent" >Desire and imagination create the world and intelligence reconciles the

am aware, yet unaffected.
<!--l. 8898--><p class="noindent" ><span

return to the former state.
<!--l. 8902--><p class="noindent" ><span

surely be done and, in fact, I am doing it all the time. Like a bird on its
wings, I leave no footprints.
<!--l. 8904--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Has the witness name and form, or is it beyond these?
<!--l. 8906--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The witness is merely a point in awareness. It has no name and
form. It is like the reflection of the sun in a drop of dew. The drop of
dew has name and form, but the little point of light is caused by the
sun. The clearness and smoothness of the drop is a necessary condition
but not sufficient by itself. Similarly clarity and silence of the mind are
necessary for the reflection of reality to appear in the mind, but by
themselves they are not sufficient. There must be reality beyond it.
Because reality is timelessly present, the stress is on the necessary
conditions.
<!--l. 8908--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can it happen that the mind is clear and quiet and yet no reflection

appears?
<!--l. 8910--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is destiny to consider. The unconscious is in the grip of
destiny, it is destiny, in fact. One may have to wait. But however heavy
may be the hand of destiny, it can be lifted by patience and
self-control. Integrity and purity remove the obstacles and the vision of
reality appears in the mind.
<!--l. 8912--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one gain self-control? I am so weak-minded!
<!--l. 8914--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Understand first that you are not the person you believe
yourself to be. What you think yourself to be is mere suggestion or
imagination. You have no parents, you were not born, nor will you
die.
<!--l. 8916--><p class="noindent" >Either trust me when I tell you so, or arrive to it by study and
investigation. The way of total faith is quick, the other is slow but
steady. Both must be tested in action. Act on what you think is true

<!--l. 8920--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are deserving the truth and destiny one and the same?
<!--l. 8922--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, both are in the unconscious. Conscious merit is mere vanity.
Consciousness is always of obstacles; when there are no obstacles, one
goes beyond it.
<!--l. 8924--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Will the understanding that I am not the body give me the strength
of character needed for self-control?
<!--l. 8926--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you know that you are neither body nor mind, you
will not be swayed by them. You will follow truth, wherever it
takes you, and do what needs be done, whatever the price to

pay.
<!--l. 8928--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is action essential for self-realisation?
<!--l. 8930--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>For realisation, understanding is essential. Action is only incidental.
A man of steady understanding will not refrain from action. Action is
the test of truth.
<!--l. 8932--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are tests needed?
<!--l. 8934--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you do not test yourself all the time, you will not be able to
distinguish between reality and fancy. Observation and close reasoning
help to some extent, but reality is paradoxical. How do you know that
you have realised unless you watch your thoughts and feelings, words
and actions and wonder at the changes occurring in you without your
knowing why and how? It is exactly because they are so surprising that
you know that they are real. The foreseen and expected is rarely
true.
<!--l. 8936--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does the person come into being?
<!--l. 8938--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Exactly as a shadow appears when light is intercepted by the body,
so does the person arise when pure self-awareness is obstructed by the
&#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; idea. And as the shadow changes shape and position
according to the lay of the land, so does the person appear to rejoice
and suffer, rest and toil, find and lose according to the pattern
of destiny. When the body is no more, the person disappears
completely without return, only the witness remains and the Great
Unknown.
<!--l. 8940--><p class="noindent" >The witness is that which says &#8216;I know&#8217;. The person says &#8216;I do&#8217;. Now, to
say &#8216;I know&#8217; is not untrue &#8211; it is merely limited. But to say &#8216;I do&#8217; is
altogether false, because there is nobody who does; all happens by
itself, including the idea of being a doer.

<!--l. 8942--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then what is action?
<!--l. 8944--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The universe is full of action, but there is no actor. There are
numberless persons small and big and very big, who, through
identification, imagine themselves as acting, but it does not change the
fact that the world of action ( mahadakash) is one single whole in
which all depends on, and affects all. The stars affect us deeply and we
affect the stars. Step back from action to consciousness, leave action to
the body and the mind; it is their domain. Remain as pure witness, till
even witnessing dissolves in the Supreme.
<!--l. 8946--><p class="noindent" >Imagine a thick jungle full of heavy timber. A plank is shaped out
of the timber and a small pencil to write on it. The witness
reads the writing and knows that while the pencil and the plank
are distantly related to the jungle, the writing has nothing to
do with it. It is totally super-imposed and its disappearance
just does not matter. The dissolution of personality is followed
always by a sense of great relief, as if a heavy burden has fallen
off.
<!--l. 8948--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When you say, I am in the state beyond the witness, what is the
experience that makes you say so? In what way does it differ from the
stage of being a witness only?
<!--l. 8950--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is like washing printed cloth. First the design fades, then
the background and in the end the cloth is plain white. The
personality gives place to the witness, then the witness goes and pure
awareness remains. The cloth was white in the beginning and is
white in the end; the patterns and colours just happened &#8211; for a
time.
<!--l. 8952--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can there be awareness without an object of awareness?
<!--l. 8954--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Awareness with an object we called witnessing. When there is also

self-identification with the object, caused by desire or fear, such a state
is called a person. In reality there is only one state; when distorted by
self-identification it is called a person, when coloured with the sense of
being, it is the witness; when colourless and limitless, it is called the
Supreme.
<!--l. 8956--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find that I am always restless, longing, hoping, seeking, finding,
enjoying, abandoning, searching again. What is it that keeps me on the
boil?
<!--l. 8958--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are really in search of yourself, without knowing it. You are
love-longing for the love-worthy, the perfectly lovable. Due to
ignorance you are looking for it in the world of opposites and
contradictions. When you find it within, your search will be
over.

<!--l. 8962--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t anticipate. You do not know. It is true that all manifestation
is in the opposites. Pleasure and pain, good and bad, high and low,
progress and regress, rest and strife they all come and go together &#8211;
and as long as there is a world, its contradictions will be there. There
may also be periods of perfect harmony, of bliss and beauty, but only
for a time. What is perfect, returns to the source of all perfection and
the opposites play on.
<!--l. 8964--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to reach perfection?
<!--l. 8966--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Keep quiet. Do your work in the world, but inwardly keep quiet.
Then all will come to you. Do not rely on your work for realisation. It
may profit others, but not you. Your hope lies in keeping silent
in your mind and quiet in your heart. realised people are very
quiet.

experience depending on the body and the mind for its occurrence?
<!--l. 8979--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All experience is illusory, limited and temporal. Expect nothing
from experience. realisation by itself is not an experience, though it
may lead to a new dimension of experiences. Yet the new experiences,
however interesting, are not more real than the old. Definitely
realisation is not a new experience. It is the discovery of the
timeless factor in every experience. It is awareness, which makes
experience possible. Just like in all the colours light is the colourless
factor, so in every experience awareness is present, yet it is not an
experience.
<!--l. 8981--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If awareness is not an experience, how can it be realised?
<!--l. 8983--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Awareness is ever there. It need not be realised. Open the shutter
of the mind, and it will be flooded with light.
<!--l. 8985--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is matter?

<!--l. 8987--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What you do not understand is matter.
<!--l. 8989--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Science understands matter.
<!--l. 8991--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Science merely pushes back the frontiers of our ignorance.
<!--l. 8993--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what is nature?
<!--l. 8995--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The totality of conscious experiences is nature. As a conscious self
you are a part of nature. As awareness, you are beyond. Seeing nature
as mere consciousness is awareness.
<!--l. 8997--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are there levels of awareness?
<!--l. 8999--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There are levels in consciousness, but not in awareness. It is of
one block, homogeneous. Its reflection in the mind is love and
understanding. There are levels of clarity in understanding and
intensity in love, but not in their source. The source is simple and
single, but its gifts are infinite.
<!--l. 9001--><p class="noindent" >Only do not take the gifts for the source. realise yourself as the source
and not as the river; that is all.
<!--l. 9003--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am the river too.
<!--l. 9005--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course, you are. As an &#8216;I am&#8217; you are the river, flowing between
the banks of the body. But you are also the source and the ocean and
the clouds in the sky. Wherever there is life and consciousness, you are.
Smaller than the smallest, bigger than the biggest, you are, while all
else appears.
<!--l. 9007--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The sense of being and the sense of living &#8211; are they one and the
same, or different?

<!--l. 9009--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The identity in space creates one, the continuity in time creates the
other.
<!--l. 9011--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You said once that the seer, seeing and the seen are one single
thing, not three. To me the three are separate. I do not doubt your
words, only I do not understand.
<!--l. 9013--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Look closely and you will see that the seer and the seen appear
only when there is seeing.
<!--l. 9015--><p class="noindent" >They are attributes of seeing. When you say &#8216;I am seeing this&#8217;. &#8216;I am&#8217;
and &#8216;this&#8217; come with seeing, not before. You cannot have an unseen
&#8216;this&#8217; nor an unseeing &#8216;I am&#8217;.
<!--l. 9017--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can say: &#8216;I do not see&#8217;.
<!--l. 9019--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The &#8216;I am seeing this&#8217; has become &#8216;l am seeing my not seeing&#8217;, or &#8216;I
am seeing darkness&#8217;. The seeing remains. In the triplicity: the known,
knowing and the knower, only the knowing is a fact. The &#8216;I am&#8217; and
&#8216;this&#8217; are doubtful. Who knows? What is known? There is no certainty,
except that there is knowing.
<!--l. 9022--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why am I sure of knowing, but not of the knower?
<!--l. 9024--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Knowing is a reflection of your true nature along with being and
loving. The knower and the known are added by the mind. It is in the
nature of the mind to create a subject-object duality, where there is
none.
<!--l. 9026--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the cause of desire and fear?
<!--l. 9028--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Obviously, the memory of past pains and pleasures. There is no
great mystery about it. Conflict arises only when desire and fear refer
to the same object.

<!--l. 9030--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How to put an end to memory?
<!--l. 9032--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is neither necessary, nor possible. realise that all happens in
consciousness and you are the root, the source, the foundation of
consciousness. The world is but a succession of experiences and you are
what makes them conscious, and yet remain beyond all experience. It is
like the heat, the flame and the burning wood. The heat maintains the
flame, the flame consumes the wood. Without heat there would be
neither flame nor fuel. Similarly, without awareness there would be no
consciousness, nor life, which transforms matter into a vehicle of
consciousness.
<!--l. 9034--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You maintain that without me there would be no world, and that
the world and my knowledge of the world are identical. Science has
come to a quite different conclusion: the world exists as something
concrete and continuous, while I am a by-product of biological
evolution of the nervous system, which is primarily not so much a seat
of consciousness, as a mechanism of survival as individual and
species. Yours is altogether a subjective view, while science tries
to describe everything in objective terms. Is this contradiction
inevitable?
<!--l. 9036--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The confusion is apparent and purely verbal. What is, is. It is
neither subjective nor objective.
<!--l. 9038--><p class="noindent" >Matter and mind are not separate, they are aspects of one energy. Look
at the mind as a function of matter and you have science; look at
matter as the product of the mind and you have religion.
<!--l. 9040--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But what is true? What comes first, mind or matter?
<!--l. 9042--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither comes first. for neither appears alone. Matter is the shape,
mind is the name. Together they make the world. Pervading and
transcending is Reality, pure being &#8211; awareness &#8211; bliss, your very

essence.
<!--l. 9044--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All I know is the stream of consciousness, an endless succession
of events. The river of time flows, bringing and carrying away
relentlessly. Transformation of the future into past is going on all the
time.
<!--l. 9046--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Are you not the victim of your language? You speak about the
flow of time, as if you were stationary. But the events you have
witnessed yesterday somebody else may see tomorrow. It is you
who are in movement and not time. Stop moving and time will
cease.
<!--l. 9048--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What does it mean &#8211; time will cease?
<!--l. 9050--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Past and future will merge in the eternal now.
<!--l. 9052--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But what does it mean in actual experience? How do you know that
for you time has ceased?
<!--l. 9054--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It may mean that past and future do not matter any more. It may
also mean that all that happened and will happen becomes an open
book to be read at will.
<!--l. 9056--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can imagine a sort of cosmic memory, accessible with some
training. But how can the future be known? The unexpected is
inevitable.
<!--l. 9058--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is unexpected on one level may be certain to happen, when
seen from a higher level After all, we are within the limits of the mind.
In reality nothing happens, there is no past nor future; all appears and
nothing is.
<!--l. 9060--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What does it mean, nothing is? Do you turn blank, or go to sleep?

Or do you dissolve the world and keep us all in abeyance, until we are
brought back to life at the next flicker of your thought?
<!--l. 9062--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Oh, no, it is not that bad. The world of mind and matter, of names
and shapes, continues, but it does not matter to me at all. It is like
having a shadow. It is there &#8211; following me wherever I go, but not
hindering me in any way. It remains a world of experiences, but not of
names and forms related to me by desires and fears. The experiences
are qualityless, pure experiences, if I may say so. I call them
experiences for the lack of a better word. They are like the waves on
the surface of the ocean, the ever-present, but not affecting its peaceful
power.
<!--l. 9064--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You mean to say an experience can be nameless, formless,
undefined?
<!--l. 9066--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In the beginning all experience is such. It is only desire and fear,
born of memory, that give it name and form and separate it from
other experiences. It is not a conscious experience, for it is not in
opposition to other experiences, yet it is an experience all the
same.
<!--l. 9068--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If it is not conscious, why talk about it?
<!--l. 9070--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Most of your experiences are unconscious. The conscious
ones are very few. You are unaware of the fact because to you
only the conscious ones count. Become aware of the unconscious
.
<!--l. 9072--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can one be aware of the unconscious? How is it done?
<!--l. 9074--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Desire and fear are the obscuring and distorting factors. When
mind is free of them the unconscious becomes accessible.

<!--l. 9076--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it mean that the unconscious becomes conscious?
<!--l. 9078--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is rather the other way round. The conscious becomes one with
the unconscious. The distinction ceases, whichever way you look at
it.
<!--l. 9080--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am puzzled. How can one be aware and yet unconscious?
<!--l. 9082--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Awareness is not limited to consciousness. It is of all that is.
Consciousness is of duality. There is no duality in awareness. It is one
single block of pure cognition. In the same way one can talk of the
pure being and pure creation &#8211; nameless, formless, silent and yet
absolutely real, powerful, effective. Their being indescribable does not
affect them in the least. While they are unconscious, they are
essential. The conscious cannot change fundamentally, it can only
modify. Any thing, to change, must pass through death, through
obscuration and dissolution. Gold jewellery must be melted down
before it is cast into another shape. What refuses to die cannot be
reborn.
<!--l. 9084--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Barring the death of the body, how does one die?
<!--l. 9086--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Withdrawal, aloofness, letting go is death. To live fully, death is
essential; every ending makes a new beginning. On the other hand, do
understand, that only the dead can die, not the living. That which is
alive in you, is immortal.
<!--l. 9088--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>From where does desire draw its energy?
<!--l. 9090--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Its name and shape it draws from memory. The energy flows from
the source.
<!--l. 9092--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Some desires are altogether wrong. How can wrong desires flow from
a sublime source?

<!--l. 9094--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The source is neither right nor wrong. Nor is desire by itself
right or wrong. It is nothing but striving for happiness. Having
identified yourself with a speck of a body you feel lost and search
desperately for the sense of fullness and completeness you call
happiness.
<!--l. 9096--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When did I lose it? I never had it.
<!--l. 9098--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You had it before you woke up this morning. Go beyond your
consciousness and you will find it.
<!--l. 9100--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to go beyond?
<!--l. 9102--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You know it already; do it.
<!--l. 9104--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>That&#8217;s what you say. I know nothing about it.
<!--l. 9106--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yet I repeat &#8211; you know it. Do it. Go beyond, back to your normal,
natural, supreme state.
<!--l. 9108--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I&#8217;m puzzled.
<!--l. 9110--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A speck in the eye makes you think you are blind. Wash it out and
look.
<!--l. 9112--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do look! I see only darkness.
<!--l. 9114--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Remove the speck and your eyes will be flooded with light. The
light is there &#8211; waiting. The eyes are there &#8211; ready. The darkness you
see is but the shadow of the tiny speck. Get rid of it and come back to
your natural state.

<!--l. 9117--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Where do you come from?
<!--l. 9119--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I am from the United States, but I live mostly in Europe.
To India I came recently. I was in Rishikesh, in two Ashrams. I was
taught meditation and breathing.
<!--l. 9121--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How long were you there?
<!--l. 9123--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Eight days in one, six days in another. I was not happy there and I
left. Then for three weeks I was with the Tibetan Lamas. But they
were all wrapped up in formulas and rituals.
<!--l. 9125--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>And what was the net result of it all?
<!--l. 9127--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Definitely there was an increase of energy. But before I left
for Rishikesh, I did some fasting and dieting at a Nature Cure
Sanatorium at Pudukkotai in South India. It has done me enormous
good.
<!--l. 9129--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe the access of energy was due to better health.
<!--l. 9131--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I cannot say. But as a result of all these attempts some fires started
burning in various places in my body and I heard chants and voices
where there were none.
<!--l. 9133--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>And what are you after now?
<!--l. 9135--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Well, what are we all after? Some truth, some inner certainty, some
real happiness. In the various schools of self-realisation there is
so much talk of awareness, that one ends with the impression
that awareness itself is the supreme reality. Is it so? The body is
looked after by the brain, the brain is illumined by consciousness;

awareness watches over consciousness; is there anything beyond
awareness?
<!--l. 9137--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How do you know that you are aware?
<!--l. 9139--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I feel that I am. I cannot express it otherwise.
<!--l. 9141--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you follow it up carefully from brain through consciousness
to awareness, you find that the sense of duality persists. When you go
beyond awareness, there is a state of non-duality, in which there is no
cognition, only pure being, which may be as well called non-being, if by
being you mean being something in particular.
<!--l. 9143--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What you call pure being is it universal being, being everything?
<!--l. 9145--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Everything implies a collection of particulars. In pure being the
very idea of the particular is absent.
<!--l. 9147--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there any relationship between pure being and particular
being?
<!--l. 9149--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What relationship can there be between what is and what merely
appears to be? Is there any relationship between the ocean and its
waves? The real enables the unreal to appear and causes it to
disappear. the succession of transient moments creates the illusion of
time, but the timeless reality of pure being is not in movement, for all
movement requires a motionless background. It is itself the background.
Once you have found it in yourself, you know that you had never lost
that independent being, independent of all divisions and separations.
But don&#8217;t look for it in consciousness, you will not find it there. Don&#8217;t
look for it anywhere, for nothing contains it. On the contrary,
it contains everything and manifests everything. It is like the
daylight that makes everything visible while itself remaining
invisible.

<!--l. 9151--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, of what use to me is your telling me that reality cannot be
found in consciousness? Where else am I to look for it? How do you
apprehend it?
<!--l. 9153--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is quite simple. If I ask you what is the taste of your mouth all
you can do is to say: it is neither sweet nor bitter, nor sour nor
astringent; it is what remains when all these tastes are not. Similarly,
when all distinctions and reactions are no more, what remains is reality,
simple and solid.
<!--l. 9155--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All that I understand is that I am in the grip of a beginningless
illusion. And I do not see how it can come to an end. If it could, it
would &#8211; long ago. I must have had as many opportunities in the past as
I shall have in the future. What could not happen cannot happen. Or,
if it did, it could not last. Our very deplorable state after all these
untold millions of years carries, at best, the promise of ultimate
extinction, or, which is worse, the threat of an endless and meaningless
repetition.
<!--l. 9157--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What proof have you that your present state is beginningless and
endless? How were you before you were born? How will you be after
death? And of your present state &#8211; how much do you know? You do not
know even what was your condition before you woke up this morning?
You only know a little of your present state and from it you draw
conclusions for all times and places. You may be just dreaming and
imagining your dream to be eternal.
<!--l. 9159--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Calling it a dream does not change the situation. I repeat
my question: what hope is left which the eternity behind me
could not fulfil? Why should my future be different from my
past?
<!--l. 9161--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In your fevered state, you project a past and a future and take
them to be real. In fact, you know only your present moment. Why not

investigate what is now, instead of questioning the imaginary past and
future? Your present state is neither beginningless nor endless.
If is over in a flash. Watch carefully from where it comes and
where it goes. You will soon discover the timeless reality behind
it.
<!--l. 9163--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why have I not done it before?
<!--l. 9165--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Just as every wave subsides into the ocean, so does every moment
return to its source.
<!--l. 9167--><p class="noindent" >realisation consists in discovering the source and abiding there.
<!--l. 9169--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who discovers?
<!--l. 9171--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind discovers.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it find the answers?
<!--l. 9175--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It finds that it is left without questions, that no answers are
needed.
<!--l. 9177--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Being born is a fact. Dying is another fact. How do they appear to
the witness?
<!--l. 9179--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A child was born; a man has died &#8211; just events in the course of
time.
<!--l. 9181--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there any progress in the witness? Does awareness evolve?
<!--l. 9183--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is seen may undergo many changes when the light of
awareness is focussed on it, but it is the object that changes, not the
light. Plants grow in sunlight, but the sun does not grow. By
themselves both the body and the witness are motionless, but when

brought together in the mind, both appear to move.
<!--l. 9185--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, I can see that what moves and changes is the &#8216;I am&#8217; only. Is the
&#8216;I am&#8217; needed at all?
<!--l. 9187--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who needs it? It is there &#8211; now. It had a beginning it will have an
end.
<!--l. 9189--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What remains when the &#8216;I am&#8217; goes?
<!--l. 9191--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What does not come and go &#8211; remains. It is the ever greedy mind
that creates ideas of progress and evolution towards perfection. It
disturbs and talks of order, destroys and seeks security.
<!--l. 9193--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there progress in destiny, in karma?
<!--l. 9195--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Karma is only a store of unspent energies, of unfulfilled desires and
fears not understood. The store is being constantly replenished by new
desires and fears. It need not be so for ever.
<!--l. 9197--><p class="noindent" >Understand the root cause of your fears &#8211; estrangement from

separate and don&#8217;t look for relationship.

<!--l. 9207--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Fascinated by names and forms, which are by their very nature
distinct and diverse, you distinguish what is natural and separate what

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can see that the basic biological anxiety, the flight instinct, takes
many shapes and distorts my thoughts and feelings. But how did this
anxiety come into being?
<!--l. 9211--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is a mental state caused by the &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; idea. It can be
removed by the contrary idea: &#8216;I-am-not-the-body&#8217;. Both the ideas are
false, but one removes the other. realise that no ideas are your own,
they all come to you from outside. You must think it all out for
yourself, become yourself the object of your meditation. The effort to
understand yourself is Yoga. Be a Yogi, give your life to it, brood,
wonder, search, till you come to the root of error and to the truth
beyond the error.
<!--l. 9213--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In meditation, who meditates, the person or the witness?
<!--l. 9215--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Meditation is a deliberate attempt to pierce into the higher states
of consciousness and finally go beyond it. The art of meditation is the
art of shifting the focus of attention to ever subtler levels, without
losing one&#8217;s grip on the levels left behind. In a way it is like having
death under control. One begins with the lowest levels: social
circumstances, customs and habits; physical surroundings, the posture
and the breathing of the body, the senses, their sensations and
perceptions; the mind, its thoughts and feelings; until the entire
mechanism of personality is grasped and firmly held. The final stage of
meditation is reached when the sense of identity goes beyond the
&#8216;I-am-so-and-so&#8217;, beyond &#8216;so-l-am&#8217;, beyond &#8216;I-am-the-witness-only&#8217;,
beyond &#8216;there-is&#8217;, beyond all ideas into the impersonally personal pure
being. But you must be energetic when you take to meditation. It

is definitely not a part-time occupation. Limit your interests
and activities to what is needed for you and your dependents&#8217;
barest needs. Save all your energies and time for breaking the
wall your mind had built around you. Believe me, you will not
regret.
<!--l. 9218--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do I come to know that my experience is universal?
<!--l. 9220--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>At the end of your meditation all is known directly, no proofs
whatsoever are required. Just as every drop of the ocean carries the
taste of the ocean, so does every moment carry the taste of eternity.
Definitions and descriptions have their place as useful incentives for
further search, but you must go beyond them into what is undefinable
and indescribable, except in negative terms.
<!--l. 9222--><p class="noindent" >After all, even universality and eternity are mere concepts, the
opposites of being place and time-bound. Reality is not a concept, nor
the manifestation of a concept. It has nothing to do with concepts.
Concern yourself with your mind, remove its distortions and
impurities. Once you had the taste of your own self, you will find it
everywhere and at all times. Therefore, it is so important that
you should come to it. Once you know it, you will never lose
it.
<!--l. 9224--><p class="noindent" >But you must give yourself the opportunity through intensive, even
arduous meditation.
<!--l. 9226--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What exactly do you want me to do?
<!--l. 9228--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Give your heart and mind to brooding over the &#8216;I am&#8217;, what is it,
how is it, what is its source, its life, its meaning. It is very much like
digging a well. You reject all that is not water, till you reach the
life-giving spring.

<!--l. 9230--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How shall I know that I am moving in the right direction?
<!--l. 9232--><p class="noindent" ><span

task.
<!--l. 9234--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We, Europeans, find it very difficult to keep quiet. The world is too
much with us.
<!--l. 9236--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Oh, no, you are dreamers too. We differ only in the contents of our
dreams. You are after perfection &#8211; in the future. We are intent on
finding it &#8211; in the now. The limited only is perfectible.
<!--l. 9238--><p class="noindent" >The unlimited is already perfect. You are perfect, only you don&#8217;t know
it. Learn to know yourself and you will discover wonders.
<!--l. 9240--><p class="noindent" >All you need is already within you, only you must approach your self
with reverence and love. Self-condemnation and self-distrust are
grievous errors. Your constant flight from pain and search for pleasure
is a sign of love you bear for your self, all I plead with you is this: make
love of your self perfect. Deny yourself nothing &#8211; glue your self infinity
and eternity and discover that you do not need them; you are
beyond.

Responsible. Who is?
<!--l. 9258--><p class="noindent" ><span

there be no existence without strife? I need not fight others to be
myself.

<!--l. 9262--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You fight others all the time for your survival as a separate
body-mind, a particular name and form. To live you must destroy.
From the moment you were conceived you started a war with your

sets you free.
<!--l. 9264--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My question remains unanswered. You are merely describing what I

the final answer.
<!--l. 9266--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The final answer is this: nothing is. All is a momentary appearance

child?
<!--l. 9270--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nobody and everybody. The world is what it contains and each
thing affects all others. We all kill the child and we all die with it.
Every event has innumerable causes and produces numberless effects. It
is useless to keep accounts, nothing is traceable.

<!--l. 9274--><p class="noindent" ><span

burden.
<!--l. 9276--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So, the innocent suffers for the guilty?

<!--l. 9278--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In our ignorance we are innocent; in our actions we are guilty. We
sin without knowing and suffer without understanding. Our only hope:
to stop, to look, to understand and to get out of the traps of memory.
For memory feeds imagination and imagination generates desire and
fear.
<!--l. 9280--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why do I imagine at all?
<!--l. 9282--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The light of consciousness passes through the film of memory and
throws pictures on your brain. Because of the deficient and disordered
state of your brain, what you perceive is distorted and coloured by
feelings of like and dislike. Make your thinking orderly and free from
emotional overtones, and you will see people and things as they are,
with clarity and charity.
<!--l. 9284--><p class="noindent" >The witness of birth, life and death is one and the same. It is the
witness of pain and of love. For while the existence in limitation and
separation is sorrowful, we love it. We love it and hate it at the same
time. We fight, we kill, we destroy life and property and yet we are
affectionate and self-sacrificing. We nurse the child tenderly and orphan
it too. Our life is full of contradictions. Yet we cling to it. This clinging
is at the root of everything. Still, it is entirely superficial. We hold on
to something or somebody, with all our might and next moment we
forget it; like a child that shapes its mud-pies and abandons them
light-heartedly. Touch them &#8211; it will scream with anger, divert the
child and he forgets them. For our life is now, and the love of it
is now. We love variety, the play of pain and pleasure, we are
fascinated by contrasts. For this we need the opposites and their
apparent separation. We enjoy them for a time and then get
tired and crave for the peace and silence of pure being. The
cosmic heart beats ceaselessly. I am the witness and the heart
too.
<!--l. 9286--><p class="noindent" ><span

this terrible and yet adorable experience?
<!--l. 9288--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The painter is in the picture. You separate the painter from the
picture and look for him. Don&#8217;t separate and don&#8217;t put false questions.
Things are as they are and nobody in particular is responsible. The
idea of personal responsibility comes from the illusion of agency.
&#8216;Somebody must have done it, somebody is responsible&#8217;. Society
as it is now, with its framework of laws and customs, is based
on the idea of a separate and responsible personality, but this
is not the only form a society can take. There may be other
forms, where the sense of separation is weak and responsibility
diffused.
<!--l. 9290--><p class="noindent" ><span

self-realisation?
<!--l. 9292--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Take the case of a young child. The sense of &#8216;I-am&#8217; is not yet
formed, the personality is rudimentary. The obstacles to self knowledge
are few, but the power and the clarity of awareness, its width and
depth are lacking. In the course of years awareness will grow
stronger, but also the latent personality will emerge and obscure and
complicate. Just as the harder the wood, the hotter the flame, so the
stronger the personality, brighter the light generated from its
destruction.

becoming, as it is in the very nature of becoming to seek peace in
being. This alteration of being and becoming is inevitable; but my

different. I do not look at death as a calamity as I do not rejoice at the

and, therefore, it stagnates and decays. From the summit all roads
lead downwards. Societies are like people &#8211; they are born, they

now. It is your behaviour that blinds you to yourself. Disregard
whatever you think yourself to be and act as if you were absolutely

perfect &#8211; whatever your idea of perfection may be. All you need is
courage.

<!--l. 9368--><p class="noindent" ><span

meaningful and beautiful.

<!--l. 9376--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What can it gain? Nothing whatsoever. But it is in the nature of
love to express itself, to affirm itself, to overcome difficulties. Once you

have understood that the world is love in action, you will look at it
quite differently. But first your attitude to suffering must change.
Suffering is primarily a call for attention, which itself is a movement of
love. More than happiness, love wants growth, the widening and
deepening of consciousness and being. Whatever prevents becomes a
cause of pain, and love does not shirk from pain. Sattva, the energy
that works for righteousness and orderly development, must not be
thwarted. When obstructed it turns against itself and becomes
destructive. Whenever love is withheld and suffering allowed to spread,
war becomes inevitable.

 id="x1-8800083"></a>The True Guru</h2>
<!--l. 9381--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>You were saying the other day that at the root of your
realisation was the trust in your Guru. He assured you that you were
already the Absolute Reality and there was nothing more to be done.
You trusted him and left it at that, without straining, without striving.
Now, my question is: without trust in your Guru would you have
realised? After all, what you are, You are, whether your mind trusts or
not; would doubt obstruct the action of the Guru&#8217;s words and make
them inoperative?
<!--l. 9383--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You have said it &#8211; they would have been made inoperative &#8211;
for a time.
<!--l. 9385--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what would happen to the energy, or power in the Guru&#8217;s
words?
<!--l. 9387--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It would remain latent, unmanifested. But the entire question is
based on a misunderstanding.
<!--l. 9389--><p class="noindent" >The master, the disciple, the love and trust between them, these are
one fact, not so many independent facts. Each is a part of the other.
Without love and trust there would have been no Guru nor disciple,
and no relationship between them. It is like pressing a switch to light
an electric lamp. It is because the lamp, the wiring, the switch, the
transformer, the transmission lines and the power house form a single
whole, that you get the light. Any one factor missing and there would
be no light. You must not separate the inseparable. Words do not
create facts; they either describe them or distort. The fact is always
non-verbal.
<!--l. 9391--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I still do not understand; can the Guru&#8217;s word remain unfulfilled or
will it invariably prove true?

<!--l. 9393--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Words of a realised man never miss their purpose. They wait for
the right conditions to arise which may take some time, and.
this is natural, for there is a season for sowing and a season
for harvesting. But the word of a Guru is a seed that cannot
perish. Of course, the Guru must be a real one, who is beyond the
body and the mind, beyond consciousness itself, beyond space
and time, beyond duality and unity, beyond understanding and
description. The good people who have read a lot and have a
lot to say, may teach you many useful things, but they are not
the real Gurus whose words invariably come true. They also
may tell you that you are the ultimate reality itself, but what of
it?
<!--l. 9395--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Nevertheless, if for some reason I happen to trust them and obey,
shall I be the loser?
<!--l. 9397--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you are able to trust and obey, you will soon find your real Guru,
or rather, he will find you.
<!--l. 9399--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does every knower of the Self become a Guru, or can one be a
knower of Reality without being able to take others to it?
<!--l. 9401--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you know what you teach, you can teach what you know, Here
seership and teachership are one. But the Absolute Reality is beyond
both. The self-styled Gurus talk of ripeness and effort, of merits and
achievements, of destiny and grace; all these are mere mental
formations, projections of an addicted mind. Instead of helping, they
obstruct.
<!--l. 9403--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I make out whom to follow and whom to mistrust?
<!--l. 9405--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Mistrust all, until you are convinced. The true Guru will never
humiliate you, nor will he estrange you from yourself. He will
constantly bring you back to the fact of your inherent perfection

and encourage you to seek within. He knows you need nothing,
not even him, and is never tired of reminding you. But the self
appointed Guru is more concerned with himself than with his
disciples.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You said that reality is beyond the knowledge and the teaching of
the real. Is not the knowledge of reality the supreme itself and teaching
the proof of its attainment?
<!--l. 9409--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The knowledge of the real, or the self, is a state of mind. Teaching
another is a movement in duality. They concern the mind only; sattva
is a Guna all the same.
<!--l. 9411--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is real then?
<!--l. 9413--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>He who knows the mind as non-realised and realised, who knows
ignorance and knowledge as states of mind, he is the real. When you
are given diamonds mixed with gravel, you may either miss the
diamonds or find them. It is the seeing that matters. Where
is the greyness of the gravel and the beauty of the diamond,
without the power to see? The known is but a shape and knowledge
is but a name. The knower is but a state of mind. The real is
beyond.
<!--l. 9415--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, objective knowledge and ideas of things and self knowledge
are not one and the same thing. One needs a brain, the other does
not.
<!--l. 9417--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>For the purpose of discussion you can arrange words and give them
meaning, but the fact remains that all knowledge is a form of
ignorance. The most accurate map is yet only paper. All knowledge is
in memory; it is only recognition, while reality is beyond the duality of
the knower and the known.

<!--l. 9419--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then by what is reality known?
<!--l. 9421--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How misleading is your language! You assume, unconsciously, that
reality also is approachable through knowledge. And then you will
bring in a knower of reality beyond reality! Do understand that to be,
reality need not be known. Ignorance and knowledge are in the mind,
not in the real.
<!--l. 9423--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If there is no such thing as the knowledge of the real, then how do I
reach it?
<!--l. 9425--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You need not reach out for what is already with you. Your very
reaching out makes you miss it.
<!--l. 9427--><p class="noindent" >Give up the idea that you have not found it and just let it come into
the focus of direct perception, here and now, by removing all that is of
the mind.
<!--l. 9429--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When all that can go, goes, what remains?
<!--l. 9431--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Emptiness remains, awareness remains, pure light of the conscious
being remains. It is like asking what remains of a room when all the
furniture is removed? A most serviceable room remains. And when even
the walls are pulled down, space remains. Beyond space and time is the
here and the now of reality.
<!--l. 9433--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does the witness remain?
<!--l. 9435--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as there is consciousness, its witness is also there. The two
appear and disappear together.
<!--l. 9437--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If the witness too is transient, why is he given so much importance?
<!--l. 9439--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Just to break the spell of the known, the illusion that only the

perceivable is real.
<!--l. 9441--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Perception is primary, the witness &#8211; secondary.
<!--l. 9443--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>This is the heart of the matter. As long as you believe that only the
outer world is real, you remain its slave. To become free, your
attention must be drawn to the &#8216;I am&#8217;, the witness. Of course,
the knower and the known are one not two, but to break the
spell of the known the knower must be brought to the forefront.
Neither is primary, both are reflections in memory of the ineffable
experience, ever new and ever now, untranslatable, quicker than the
mind.
<!--l. 9445--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, I am an humble seeker, wandering from Guru to Guru in search
of release. My mind is sick, burning with desire, frozen with fear. My
days flit by, red with pain, grey with boredom. My age is advancing,
my health decaying, my future dark and frightening. At this rate I shall
live in sorrow and die in despair. Is there any hope for me? Or have I
come too late?
<!--l. 9447--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing is wrong with you, but the ideas you have of yourself are
altogether wrong. It is not you who desires, fears and suffers, it is the
person built on the foundation of your body by circumstances and
influences. You are not that person. This must be clearly established in
your mind and never lost sight of. Normally, it needs a prolonged
sadhana, years of austerities and meditation.
<!--l. 9449--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My mind is weak and vacillating. I have neither the strength nor the
tenacity for sadhana. My case, is hopeless.
<!--l. 9451--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In a way yours is a most hopeful case. There is an alternative to
sadhana, which is trust. If you cannot have the conviction born from
fruitful search, then take advantage of my discovery, which I am so
eager to share with you. I can see with the utmost clarity that you have

never been, nor are, nor will be estranged from realty, that you are the
fullness of perfection here and now and that nothing can deprive you of
your heritage, of what you are. You are in no way different from me,
only you do not know it. You do not know what you are and therefore
you imagine your self to be what you are not. Hence desires and fear
and overwhelming despair. And meaningless activity in order to
escape.
<!--l. 9453--><p class="noindent" >Just trust me and live by trusting me. I shall not mislead you.
You are the Supreme Reality beyond the world and its creator,
beyond consciousness and its witness, beyond all assertions and
denials.
<!--l. 9455--><p class="noindent" >Remember it, think of it, act on it. Abandon all sense of separation, see
yourself in all and act accordingly. With action bliss will come and,
with bliss, conviction. After all, you doubt yourself because you are in
sorrow. Happiness, natural, spontaneous and lasting cannot be
imagined. Either it is there, or it is not. Once you begin to experience
the peace, love and happiness which need no outer causes, all your
doubts will dissolve. Just catch hold of what I told you and live by
it.
<!--l. 9457--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You are telling me to live by memory?
<!--l. 9459--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are living by memory anyhow. I am merely asking you to
replace the old memories by the memory of what I told you. As you
were acting on your old memories, act on the new one. Don&#8217;t be afraid.
For some time there is bound to be a conflict between the old and the
new, but if you put yourself resolutely on the side of the new, the strife
will soon come to an end and you will realise the effortless state of
being oneself, of not being deceived by desires and fears born of
illusion.
<!--l. 9461--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Many Gurus have the habit of giving tokens of their grace &#8211;

their head cloth, or their sticks, or begging bowl, or robe, thus
transmitting or confirming the self-realisation of their disciples.
I can see no value in such practices. It is not self-realisation
that is transmitted, but self-importance. Of what earthly use is
being told something very flattering, but not true? On one hand
you are warning me against the many self-styled Gurus, on the
other you want me to trust you. Why do you claim to be an
exception?
<!--l. 9463--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I do not ask you to trust me. Trust my words and remember
them, I want your happiness, not mine. Distrust those who put a
distance between you and your true being and offer themselves as a
go-between. I do nothing of the kind. I do not even make any
promises. I merely say: if you trust my words and put them
to test, you will for yourself discover how absolutely true they
are. If you ask for a proof before you venture, I can only say: I
am the proof. I did trust my teacher&#8217;s words and kept them
in my mind and I did find that he was right, that I was, am
and shall be the Infinite Reality, embracing all, transcending
all.
<!--l. 9465--><p class="noindent" >As you say, you have neither the time nor the energy for lengthy
practices. I offer you an alternative.
<!--l. 9467--><p class="noindent" >Accept my words on trust and live anew, or live and die in sorrow.
<!--l. 9469--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It seems too good to be true.
<!--l. 9471--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t be misled by the simplicity of the advice. Very few are those
who have the courage to trust the innocent and the simple. To
know that you are a prisoner of your mind, that you live in an
imaginary world of your own creation is the dawn of wisdom. To want
nothing of it, to be ready to abandon it entirely, is earnestness.
Only such earnestness, born of true despair, will make you trust

me.
<!--l. 9473--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Have I not suffered enough?
<!--l. 9475--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Suffering has made you dull, unable to see its enormity. Your first
task is to see the sorrow in you and around you; your next to long
intensely for liberation. The very intensity of longing will guide you;
you need no other guide.
<!--l. 9477--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Suffering has made me dull, indifferent even to itself.
<!--l. 9479--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe it is not sorrow but pleasure that made you dull.
Investigate.
<!--l. 9481--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Whatever may be the cause; I am dull. I have neither the will nor
the energy.
<!--l. 9483--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Oh, no. You have enough for the first step. And each step will
generate enough energy for the next. Energy comes with confidence and
confidence comes with experience.
<!--l. 9485--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it right to change Gurus?
<!--l. 9487--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why not change? Gurus are like milestones? It is natural to move
on from one to another. Each tells you the direction and the distance,
while the sadguru, the eternal Guru, is the road itself. Once you realise
that the road is the goal and that you are always on the road,
not to reach a goal, but to enjoy its beauty and its wisdom, life
ceases to be a task and becomes natural and simple, in itself an
ecstasy.
<!--l. 9489--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So, there is no need to worship, to pray, to practice Yoga?
<!--l. 9491--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A little of daily sweeping, washing and bathing can do no harm.

Self-awareness tells you at every step what needs be done. When all is
done, the mind remains quiet.
<!--l. 9493--><p class="noindent" >Now you are in the waking state, a person with name and shape, joys
and sorrows. The person was not there before you were born, nor will
be there after you die. Instead of struggling with the person to
make it become what it is not, why not go beyond the waking
state and leave the personal life altogether? It does not mean
the extinction of the person; it means only seeing it in right
perspective.
<!--l. 9495--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>One more question. You said that before I was born I was one with
the pure being of reality; if so, who decided that I should be
born?
<!--l. 9497--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In reality you were never born and never shall die. But now you
imagine that you are, or have a body and you ask what has brought
about this state. Within the limits of illusion the answer is: desire born
from memory attracts you to a body and makes you think as one with
it. But this is true only from the relative point of view. In fact, there
is no body, nor a world to contain it; there is only a mental
condition, a dream-like state, easy to dispel by questioning its
reality.
<!--l. 9499--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>After you die, will you come again? If I live long enough, will I meet
you again.
<!--l. 9501--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To you the body is real, to me there is none. I, as you see me, exist
in your imagination only.
<!--l. 9503--><p class="noindent" >Surely, you will see me again, if and when you need me. It does not
affect me, as the Sun is not affected by sunrises and sunsets. Because it
is not affected, it is certain to be there when needed.

<!--l. 9505--><p class="noindent" >You are bent on knowledge, I am not. I do not have that sense of
insecurity that makes you crave to know. I am curious, like a child is
curious. But there is no anxiety to make me seek refuge in knowledge.
Therefore, I am not concerned whether I shall be reborn, or how long
will the world last.
<!--l. 9507--><p class="noindent" >These are questions born of fear.

<h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">Chapter&#x00A0;84</span><br /><a
 id="x1-8900084"></a>Your Goal is Your Guru</h2>
<!--l. 9511--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>You were telling us that there are many self-styled Gurus,
but a real Guru is very rare.
<!--l. 9513--><p class="noindent" >There are many jnani who imagine themselves realised, but all they
have is book knowledge and a high opinion of themselves. Sometimes
they impress, even fascinate, attract disciples and make them waste
their time in useless practices. After some years, when the disciple
takes stock of himself, he finds no change. When he complains to his
teacher, he gets the usual rebuke that he did not try hard enough. The
blame is on the lack of faith and love in the heart of the disciple, while
in reality the blame is on the Guru, who had no business in accepting
disciples and raising their hopes. How to protect oneself from such
Gurus?
<!--l. 9515--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Why be so concerned with others? Whoever may be the
Guru, if he is pure of heart and acts in good faith, he will do his
disciples no harm. If there is no progress, the fault lies with the
disciples, their laziness and lack of self-control. On the other hand, if
the disciple is earnest and applies himself intelligently and with zest to
his sadhana, he is bound to meet a more qualified teacher, who will
take him further. Your question flows from three false assumptions:
that one needs concern oneself with others; that one can evaluate
another and that the progress of the disciple is the task and
responsibility of his Guru. In reality, the Guru&#8217;s role is only to
instruct and encourage; the disciple is totally responsible for
himself.
<!--l. 9517--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are told that total surrender to the Guru is enough, that the
Guru will do the rest.
<!--l. 9519--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course, when there is total surrender, complete relinquishment
of all concern with one&#8217;s past, presents and future, with one&#8217;s physical

and spiritual security and standing, a new life dawns, full of love and
beauty; then the Guru is not important, for the disciple has broken the
shell of self-defence.
<!--l. 9521--><p class="noindent" >Complete self-surrender by itself is liberation.
<!--l. 9523--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When both the disciple and his teacher are inadequate, what will
happen?
<!--l. 9525--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In the long run all will be well. After all, the real Self of both is not
affected by the comedy they play for a time. They will sober up and
ripen and shift to a higher level of relationship.
<!--l. 9527--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Or, they may separate.
<!--l. 9529--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, they may separate. After all, no relationship is forever. Duality
is a temporary state.
<!--l. 9531--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it by accident that I met you and by another accident shall we
separate never to meet again?
<!--l. 9533--><p class="noindent" >Or is my meeting you a part of some cosmic pattern, a fragment in the
great drama of our lives?
<!--l. 9535--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The real is meaningful and the meaningful relates to reality. If our
relationship is meaningful to you and me, it cannot be accidental. The
future affects the present as much, as the past.
<!--l. 9537--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I make out who is a real saint and who is not?
<!--l. 9539--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You cannot, unless you have a clear insight into the heart of man.
Appearances are deceptive.
<!--l. 9541--><p class="noindent" >To see clearly, your mind must be pure and unattached. Unless you

know yourself well, how can you know another? And when you know
yourself &#8211; you are the other.
<!--l. 9543--><p class="noindent" >Leave others alone for some time and examine yourself. There are so
many things you do not know about yourself &#8211; what are you,
who are you, how did you come to be born, what are you doing
now and why, where are you going, what is the meaning and
purpose of your life, your death, your future? Have you a past,
have you a future? How did you come to live in turmoil and
sorrow, while your entire being strives for happiness and peace?
These are weighty matters and have to be attended to first. You
have no need, nor time for finding who is a jnani and who is
not?
<!--l. 9545--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I must select my guru rightly.
<!--l. 9547--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Be the right man and the right Guru will surely find you.
<!--l. 9549--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You are not answering my question: how to find the right
Guru?
<!--l. 9551--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But I did answer your question. Do not look for a Guru, do not
even think of one. Make your goal your Guru. After all, the Guru is but
a means to an end, not the end in itself. He is not important, it is
what you expect of him that matters to you. Now, what do you
expect?
<!--l. 9553--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By his grace I shall be made happy, powerful and peaceful.
<!--l. 9555--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What ambitions! How can a person limited in time and space,
a mere body-mind, a gasp of pain between birth and death,
be happy? The very conditions of its arising make happiness
impossible.

<!--l. 9557--><p class="noindent" >Peace, power, happiness, these are never personal states, nobody can
say &#8216;my peace&#8217;, &#8216;my power&#8217;
<!--l. 9559--><p class="noindent" >&#8211; because &#8216;mine&#8217; implies exclusivity, which is fragile and insecure.
<!--l. 9561--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I know only my conditioned existence; there is nothing else.
<!--l. 9563--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Surely, you cannot say so. In deep sleep you are not conditioned.
How ready and willing you are to go to sleep, how peaceful, free and
happy you are when asleep!
<!--l. 9565--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I know nothing of it.
<!--l. 9567--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Put it negatively. When you sleep, you are not in pain, nor bound,
nor restless.
<!--l. 9569--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I see your point. While awake, I know that I am, but am not happy;
in sleep I am, I am happy, but I don&#8217;t know it. All I need is to know
that I am free and happy.
<!--l. 9571--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite so. Now, go within, into a state which you may compare to a
state of waking sleep, in which you are aware of yourself, but not of the
world. In that state you will know, without the least trace of doubt,
that at the root of your being you are free and happy. The only trouble
is that you are addicted to experience and you cherish your memories.
In reality it is the other way round; what is remembered is never real;
the real is now.
<!--l. 9573--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All this I grasp verbally, but it does not become a part of myself. It
remains as a picture in my mind to be looked at. Is it not the task of
the Guru to give life to the picture?
<!--l. 9575--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again, it is the other way round. The picture is alive; dead is the
mind. As the mind is made of words and images, so is every reflection

in the mind. It covers up reality with verbalisation and then complains.
You say a Guru is needed, to do miracles with you. You are playing
with words only.
<!--l. 9577--><p class="noindent" >The Guru and the disciple are one single thing, like the candle and its
flame. Unless the disciple is earnest, he cannot be called a disciple.
Unless a Guru is all love and self-giving, he cannot be called a Guru.
Only reality begets reality, not the false.
<!--l. 9579--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can see that I am false. Who will make me true?
<!--l. 9581--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The very words you said will do it. The sentence: &#8216; I can see that I
am false&#8217; contains all you need for liberation. Ponder over it, go into it
deeply, go to the root of it; it will operate. The power is in the word,
not in the person.
<!--l. 9583--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do not grasp you fully. On one hand you say a Guru is needed; on
the other &#8211; the Guru can only give advice, bit the effort is mine. Please
state clearly &#8211; can one realise the Self without a Guru, or is the finding
of a true Guru essential?
<!--l. 9585--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>More essential is the finding of a true disciple. Believe me, a true
disciple is very rare, for in no time he goes beyond the need for a Guru,
by finding his own self. Don&#8217;t waste your time on trying to make out
whether the advice you get flows from knowledge only, or from
valid experience! Just follow it faithfully. Life will bring you
another Guru, if another one is needed. Or deprive you of all outer
guidance and leave you to your own lights. It is very important to
understand that it is the teaching that matters, not the person or the
Guru. You get a letter that makes you laugh or cry. It is not
the postman who does it. The Guru only tells you the good
news about your real Self and shows you the way back to it. In a
way the Guru is its messenger. There will be many messengers,
but the message is one: be what you are. Or, you can put it

differently: Until you realise yourself, you cannot know who is
your real Guru. When you realise, you find that all the Gurus
you had have contributed to your awakening. Your realisation is
the proof that your Guru was real. Therefore, take him as he
is, do what he tells you, with earnestness and zeal and trust
your heart to warn you if anything goes wrong. If doubt sets in,
don&#8217;t fight it. Cling to what is doubtless and leave the doubtful
alone.
<!--l. 9587--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have a Guru and I love him very much. But whether he is my true
Guru I do not know.
<!--l. 9589--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Watch yourself. If you see yourself changing, growing, it means you
have found the right man.
<!--l. 9591--><p class="noindent" >He may be beautiful or ugly, pleasant or unpleasant, flattering you or
scolding; nothing matters except the one crucial fact of inward
growth. If you don&#8217;t, well, he may be your friend, but not your
Guru.
<!--l. 9593--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I meet a European with some education and talk to him
about a Guru and his teachings, his reaction is: &#8216;the man must be mad
to teach such nonsense&#8217;. What am I to tell him?
<!--l. 9595--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Take him to himself. Show him, how little he knows himself, how he
takes the most absurd statements about himself for holy truth. He is
told that he is the body, was born, will die, has parents, duties, learns
to like what others like and fear what others fear. Totally a creature of
heredity and society, he lives by memory and acts by habits. Ignorant
of himself and his true interests, he pursues false aims and is always
frustrated. His life and death are meaningless and painful, and
there seems to be no way out. Then tell him, there is a way out
within his easy reach, not a conversion to another set of ideas,
but a liberation from all ideas and patterns of living. Don&#8217;t tell

him about Gurus and disciples &#8211; this way of thinking is not for
him. His is an inner path, he is moved by an inner urge and
guided by an inner light. Invite him to rebel and he will respond.
Do not try to impress on him that so-and-so is a realised man
and can be accepted as a Guru. As long as he does not trust
himself, he cannot trust another. And confidence will come with
experience.
<!--l. 9597--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How strange! I cannot imagine life without a Guru.
<!--l. 9599--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is a matter of temperament. You too are right. For you, singing
the praises of God is enough.
<!--l. 9601--><p class="noindent" >You need not desire realisation or take up a sadhana. God&#8217;s name is all
the food you need. Live on it.
<!--l. 9603--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This constant repetition of a few words, is it not a kind of
madness?
<!--l. 9605--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is madness, but it is a deliberate madness. All repetitiveness is
tamas, but repeating the name of God is sattva-tamas due to its high
purpose. Because of the presence of sattva, the tamas will wear out and
will take the shape of complete dispassion, detachment, relinquishment,
aloofness, immutability. Tamas becomes the firm foundation on which
an integrated life can be lived.
<!--l. 9607--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The immutable &#8211; does it die?
<!--l. 9609--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is changing that dies. The immutable neither lives nor dies; it is
the timeless witness of life and death. You cannot call it dead, for it is
aware. Nor can you call it alive, for it does not change. It is just like
your tape-recorder. It records, it reproduces &#8211; all by itself. You only
listen. Similarly, I watch all that happens, including my talking to you.
It is not me who talks, the words appear in my mind and then I hear

them said.
<!--l. 9611--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it not the case with everybody?
<!--l. 9613--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who said no? But you insist that you think, you speak, while to me
there is thinking, there is speaking.
<!--l. 9615--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There are two cases to consider. Either I have found a Guru, or I
have not. In each case what is the right thing to do?
<!--l. 9617--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are never without a Guru, for he is timelessly present in your
heart. Sometimes he externalises himself and comes to you as an
uplifting and reforming factor in your life, a mother, a wife, a teacher;
or he remains as an inner urge toward righteousness and perfection. All
you have to do is obey him and do what he tells you. What he wants
you to do is simple, learn self-awareness, self-control, self-surrender. It
may seem arduous, but it is easy if you are earnest. And quite
impossible if you are not. Earnestness is both necessary and sufficient.
Everything yields to earnestness.
<!--l. 9619--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What makes one earnest?
<!--l. 9621--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Compassion is the foundation of earnestness. Compassion for
yourself and others, born of suffering, your own and others.
<!--l. 9623--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must I suffer to be earnest?
<!--l. 9625--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You need not, if you are sensitive and respond to the suffering of
others, as Buddha did. But if you are callous and without pity, your
own suffering will make you ask the inevitable questions.
<!--l. 9627--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find myself suffering, but not enough. Life is unpleasant,
but bearable. My little pleasures compensate me for my small
pains and on the whole I am better off than most of the people I

know.
<!--l. 9629--><p class="noindent" >I know that my condition is precarious, that a calamity can overtake
me any moment. Must I wait for a crisis to put me on my way to
truth?
<!--l. 9631--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The moment you have seen how fragile is your condition,
you are already alert. Now, keep alert, give attention, enquire,
investigate, discover your mistakes of mind and body and abandon
them.
<!--l. 9633--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Where is the energy to come from? I am like a paralysed man in a
burning house.
<!--l. 9635--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Even paralysed people sometimes find their legs in a moment of
danger! But you are not paralysed, you merely imagine so. Make the
first step and you will be on your way.
<!--l. 9637--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I feel my hold on the body is so strong that I just cannot give up
the idea that I am the body. It will cling to me as long as the body
lasts. There are people who maintain that no realisation is possible
while alive and I feel inclined to agree with them.
<!--l. 9639--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Before you agree or disagree, why not investigate the very idea of a
body? Does the mind appear in the body or the body in the mind?
Surely there must be a mind to conceive the &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; idea. A
body without a mind cannot be &#8216;my body&#8217;. &#8216;My body&#8217; is invariably
absent when the mind is in abeyance. It is also absent when the mind is
deeply engaged in thoughts and feelings.
<!--l. 9641--><p class="noindent" >Once you realise that the body depends on the mind, and the mind
on consciousness, and consciousness on awareness and not the
other way round, your question about waiting for self-realisation
till you die is answered. It is not that you must be free from

&#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; idea first, and then realise the self. It is definitely the
other way round &#8211; you cling to the false, because you do not
know the true. Earnestness, not perfection, is a precondition to
self-realisation. Virtues and powers come with realisation, not
before.

 id="x1-9000085"></a>&#8216;I am&#8217;: The Foundation of all Experience</h2>
<!--l. 9645--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I hear you making statements about yourself like: &#8216;I am
timeless, immutable beyond attributes&#8217;, etc. How do you know these
things? And what makes you say them?
<!--l. 9647--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>I am only trying to describe the state before the &#8216;I am&#8217;
arose, but the state itself, being beyond the mind and language, is
indescribable.
<!--l. 9649--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The &#8216;I am&#8217; is the foundation of all experience. What you are trying
to describe must also be an experience, limited and transitory.
You speak of yourself as immutable. I hear the sound of the
word, I remember its dictionary meaning, but the experience of
being immutable I do not have. How can I break through the
barrier and know personally, intimately, what it means to be
immutable?
<!--l. 9651--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The word itself is the bridge. Remember it, think of it, explore it,
go round it, look at it from all directions, dive into it with earnest
perseverance: endure all delays and disappointments till suddenly the
mind turns round, away from the word, towards the reality beyond
the word. It is like trying to find a person knowing his name
only. A day comes when your enquiries bring you to him and the
name becomes reality. Words are valuable, for between the word
and its meaning there is a link and if one investigates the word
assiduously, one crosses beyond the concept into the experience at the
root of it. As a matter of fact, such repeated attempts to go
beyond the words is called meditation. Sadhana is but a persistent
attempt to cross over from the verbal to the non-verbal. The task
seems hopeless until suddenly all becomes clear and simple and
so wonderfully easy. But, as long as you are interested in your
present way of living, you will shirk from the final leap into the
unknown.

<!--l. 9653--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why should the unknown interest me? Of what use is the
unknown?
<!--l. 9655--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of no use whatsoever. But it is worthwhile to know what
keeps you within the narrow confines of the known. It is the
full and correct knowledge of the known that takes you to the
unknown. You cannot think of it in terms of uses and advantages;
to be quite detached, beyond the reach of all self-concern, all
selfish consideration, is an inescapable condition of liberation.
You may call it death; to me it is living at its most meaningful
and intense, for I am one with life in its totality and fullness
&#8211;
<!--l. 9657--><p class="noindent" >intensity, meaningfulness, harmony; what more do you want?
<!--l. 9659--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Nothing more is needed, of course. But you are talking of the
knowable.
<!--l. 9661--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of the unknowable only silence talks. The mind can talk only of
what it knows. If you diligently investigate the knowable, it dissolves
and only the unknowable remains. But with the first flicker of
imagination and interest the unknowable is obscured and the
known comes to the fore-front. The known, the changeable, is
what you live with &#8211; the unchangeable is of no use to you. It is
only when you are satiated with the changeable and long for the
unchangeable, that you are ready for the turning round and
stepping into what can be described, when seen from the level of
the mind, as emptiness and darkness. For the mind craves for
content and variety, while reality is, to the mind, contentless and
invariable.
<!--l. 9663--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It looks like death to me.
<!--l. 9665--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is. It is also all-pervading, all-conquering, intense beyond words.

No ordinary brain can stand it without being shattered; hence the
absolute need for sadhana. Purity of body and clarity of mind,
non-violence and selflessness in life are essential for survival as an
intelligent and spiritual entity.
<!--l. 9667--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are there entities in reality?
<!--l. 9669--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Identity is Reality, Reality is identity. Reality is not shapeless mass,
a wordless chaos. It is powerful, aware, blissful; compared to it your life
is like a candle to the sun.
<!--l. 9671--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>By the grace of God and your teacher&#8217;s you lost all desire and fear
and reached the immovable state. My question is simple &#8211; how do you
know that your state is immovable?
<!--l. 9673--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Only the changeable can be thought of and talked about. The
unchangeable can only be realised in silence. Once realised, it will
deeply affect the changeable, itself remaining unaffected.
<!--l. 9675--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do you know that you are the witness?
<!--l. 9677--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I do not know, I am. I am, because to be everything must be
witnessed.
<!--l. 9679--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Existence can also be accepted on hearsay.
<!--l. 9681--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Still, finally you come to the need of a direct witness. Witnessing, if
not personal and actual, must at least be possible and feasible. Direct
experience is the final proof.
<!--l. 9683--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Experience may be faulty and misleading.
<!--l. 9685--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite, but not the fact of an experience. Whatever may be the
experience, true or false, the fact of an experience taking place

cannot be denied. It is its own proof. Watch yourself closely and
you will see that whatever be the content of consciousness, the
witnessing of it does not depend on the content. Awareness is
itself and does not change with the event. The event may be
pleasant or unpleasant, minor or important, awareness is the same.
Take note of the peculiar nature of pure awareness, its natural
self-identity, without the least trace of self-consciousness, and go to
the root of it and you will soon realise that awareness is your
true nature and nothing you may be aware of, you can call your
own.
<!--l. 9687--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not consciousness and its content one and the same?
<!--l. 9689--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness is like a cloud in the sky and the water drops are the
content. The cloud needs the sun to become visible, and consciousness
needs being focussed in awareness.
<!--l. 9691--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not awareness a form of consciousness?
<!--l. 9693--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When the content is viewed without likes and dislikes, the
consciousness of it is awareness. But still there is a difference between
awareness as reflected in consciousness and pure awareness beyond
consciousness. Reflected awareness, the sense &#8216;I am aware&#8217; is the
witness, while pure awareness is the essence of reality. Reflection of the
sun in a drop of water is the reflection of the sun, no doubt, but not the
sun itself. Between awareness reflected in consciousness as the
witness and pure awareness there is a gap, which the mind cannot
cross.
<!--l. 9695--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it not depend on the way you look at it? The mind says there
is a difference. The heart says there is none.
<!--l. 9697--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course there is no difference. The real sees the real in the unreal.
It is the mind that creates the unreal and it is the mind that sees the

false as false.
<!--l. 9699--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I understood that the experience of the real follows seeing the false
as false.
<!--l. 9701--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no such thing as the experience of the real. The real is
beyond experience. All experience is in the mind. You know the real by
being real.
<!--l. 9703--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If the real is beyond words and mind, why do we talk so much
about it?
<!--l. 9705--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>For the joy of it, of course. The real is bliss supreme. Even to talk
of it is happiness.
<!--l. 9707--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I hear you talking of the unshakable and blissful. What is in your
mind when you use these words?
<!--l. 9709--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is nothing in my mind. As you hear the words, so do I hear
them. The power that makes everything happen makes them also
happen.
<!--l. 9711--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But you are speaking, not me.
<!--l. 9713--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That is how it appears to you. As I see it, two body-minds
exchange symbolic noises. In reality nothing happens.
<!--l. 9715--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Listen Sir. I am coming to you because I am in trouble. I am a poor
soul lost in a world I do not understand. I am afraid of Mother Nature
who wants me to grow, procreate and die. When I ask for the
meaning and purpose of all this, she does not answer. I have
come to you because I was told that you are kind and wise. You
talk about the changeable as false and transient and this I can
understand. But when you talk of the immutable, I feel lost. &#8216;Not

this, not that, beyond knowledge, of no use&#8217; &#8211; why talk of it all?
Does it exist, or is it a concept only, a verbal opposite to the
changeable?
<!--l. 9717--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is, it alone is. But in your present state it is of no use to you.
Just like the glass of water near your bed if of no use to you, when you
dream that you are dying of thirst in a desert. I am trying to wake you
up, whatever your dream.
<!--l. 9719--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Please don&#8217;t tell me that I am dreaming and that I will soon wake
up. I wish it were so. But I am awake and in pain. You talk of a
painless state, but you add that I cannot have it in my present
condition. I feel lost.
<!--l. 9721--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t feel lost. I only say that to find the immutable and
blissful you must give up your hold on the mutable and painful.
You are concerned with your own happiness and I am telling
you that there is no such thing. Happiness is never your own,
it is where the &#8216;I&#8217; is not. I do not say it is beyond your reach;
you have only to reach out beyond yourself, and you will find
it.
<!--l. 9723--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I have to go beyond myself, why did I get the &#8216;I am&#8217; idea in the
first instance?
<!--l. 9725--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind needs a centre to draw a circle. The circle may grow
bigger and with every increase there will be a change in the sense
&#8216;I am&#8217;. A man who took himself in hand, a Yogi, will draw a
spiral, yet the centre will remain, however vast the spiral. A
day comes when the entire enterprise is seen as false and given
up. The central point is no more and the universe becomes the
centre.
<!--l. 9727--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, maybe. But what am I to do now?

<!--l. 9729--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Assiduously watch your ever-changing life, probe deeply into the
motives beyond your actions and you will soon prick the bubble in
which you are enclosed. A chic needs the shell to grow, but a day comes
when the shell must be broken. If it is not, there will be suffering and
death.
<!--l. 9731--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you mean to say that if I do not take to Yoga, I am doomed to
extinction?
<!--l. 9733--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is the Guru who will come to your rescue. In the meantime
be satisfied with watching the flow of your life; if your watchfulness is
deep and steady, ever turned towards the source, it will gradually move
upstream till suddenly it becomes the source. Put your awareness to
work, not your mind. The mind is not the right instrument for this
task. The timeless can be reached only by the timeless. Your body and
your mind are both subject to time; Only awareness is timeless, even in
the now. In awareness you are facing facts and reality is fond of
facts.
<!--l. 9735--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You rely entirely on my awareness to take me over and not on the
Guru and God.
<!--l. 9737--><p class="noindent" ><span

use them. But returning to the source is your own task.

<!--l. 9741--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There are innumerable gods, each in his own universe. They
create and re-create eternally. Are you going to wait for them to
save you? What you need for salvation is already within your
reach.
<!--l. 9743--><p class="noindent" >Use it. Investigate what you know to its very end and you will reach
the unknown layers of your being. Go further and the unexpected will

explode in you and shatter all.
<!--l. 9745--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it mean death?
<!--l. 9747--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 9757--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What a question to ask! The space in Bombay is asked what is its
opinion of the space in Poona. The names differ, but not the space. The
word &#8216;Babaji&#8217; is merely as address. Who lives under the address? You
ask questions when you are in trouble. Enquire who is giving trouble
and to whom.
<!--l. 9759--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I understand everybody is under the obligation to realise. Is it his
duty, or his destiny?
<!--l. 9761--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Realisation is of the fact that you are not a person. Therefore, it
cannot be the duty of the person whose destiny is to disappear. Its
destiny is the duty of him who imagines himself to be the person. Find
out who he is and the imagined person will dissolve. Freedom is from
something. What are you to be free from? Obviously, you must be free
from the person, you take yourself to be, for it is the idea you have of
yourself that keeps you in bondage.
<!--l. 9763--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is the person removed?
<!--l. 9765--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By determination. Understand that it must go and wish it to go &#8211;
it shall go if you are earnest about it. Somebody, anybody, will tell you
that you are pure consciousness, not a body-mind.
<!--l. 9767--><p class="noindent" >Accept it as a possibility and investigate earnestly. You may discover

dry it is again the normal cloth. Water has left it and who can make
out that it was wet? Your real nature is not like what you appear to be.
Give up the idea of being a person, that is all. You need not
become what you are anyhow. There is the identity of what
you are and there is the person superimposed on it. All you
know is the person, the identity &#8211; which is not a person &#8211; you
do not know, for you never doubted, never asked yourself the
crucial question &#8211; &#8216;Who am I&#8217;. The identity is the witness of the
person and sadhana consists in shifting the emphasis from the
superficial and changeful person to the immutable and ever-present
witness.
<!--l. 9773--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is it that the question &#8216;Who am I&#8217; attracts me little? I prefer to

<!--l. 9775--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Abiding in your own being is also holy company. If you have no
problem of suffering and release from suffering, you will not find the

a crisis. It must be genuine.

<!--l. 9779--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It happens every moment, but you are not alert enough. A
shadow on your neighbour&#8217;s face, the immense and all-pervading
sorrow of existence is a constant factor in your life, but you refuse

was it? You may cure yourself of all diseases, but if you are still under
the influence of the primordial drug, of what use are the superficial
cures?
<!--l. 9791--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 9793--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You may change the name, but the fact remains. What is
the drug which you call karma or destiny? It made you believe
yourself to be what you are not. What is it, and can you be free of
it?

<!--l. 9795--><p class="noindent" >Before you go further you must accept, at least as a working theory,
that you are not what you appear to be, that you are under the
influence of a drug. Then only will you have the urge and the
patience to examine the symptoms and search for their common
cause. All that a Guru can tell you is: &#8216;My dear Sir, you are
quite mistaken about yourself. You are not the person you think
yourself to be.&#8217; Trust nobody, not even yourself. Search, find out,
remove and reject every assumption till you reach the living
waters and the rock of truth. Until you are free of the drug, all
your religions and sciences, prayers and Yogas are of no use to
you, for based on a mistake, they strengthen it. But if you stay
with the idea that you are not the body nor the mind, not even
their witness, but altogether beyond, your mind will grow in
clarity, your desires &#8211; in purity, your actions &#8211; in charity and
that inner distillation will take you to another world, a world of
truth and fearless love. Resist your old habits of feeling and
thinking; keep on telling yourself: &#8216;No, not so, it cannot be so; I am
not like this, I do not need it, I do not want it&#8217;, and a day will
surely come when the entire structure of error and despair will
collapse and the ground will be free for a new life. After all, you
must remember, that all your preoccupations with yourself are
only in your waking hours and partly in your dreams; in sleep
all is put aside and forgotten. It shows how little important is
your waking life, even to yourself, that merely lying down and
closing the eyes can end it. Each time you go to sleep you do so
without the least certainty of waking up and yet you accept the
risk.
<!--l. 9797--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 9799--><p class="noindent" ><span

person.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can you give us the taste of the experience of self-realisation?

<!--l. 9803--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Take the whole of it! It is here for the asking. But you do not ask.
Even when you ask, you do not take. Find out what prevents you from
taking.
<!--l. 9805--><p class="noindent" ><span

you are locked up within your mind, my state is beyond your

<!--l. 9809--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find I have no more questions to ask.
<!--l. 9811--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Were you really at war with your ego, you would have put many
more questions. You are short of questions because you are not
really interested. At present you are moved by the pleasure-pain
principle which is the ego. You are going along with the ego, you
are not fighting it. You are not even aware how totally you are
swayed by personal considerations. A man should always revolt
against himself, for the ego, like a crooked mirror, narrows down
and distorts. It is the worst of all the tyrants, it dominates you
absolutely.
<!--l. 9813--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When there is no &#8216;I&#8217; who is free?
<!--l. 9815--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world is free of a mighty nuisance. Good enough.
<!--l. 9817--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Good for whom?
<!--l. 9819--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Good for everybody. It is like a rope stretched across the street,
it snarls up the traffic. Roll up, it is there, as mere identity,
useful when needed. Freedom from the ego-self is the fruit of
self-enquiry.
<!--l. 9821--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There was a time when I was most displeased with myself. Now I

have met my Guru and I am at peace, after having surrendered myself
to him completely.
<!--l. 9823--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you watch your daily life you will see that you have surrendered
nothing. You have merely added the word &#8216;surrender&#8217; to your
vocabulary and made your Guru into a peg to hang your problems on.
Real surrender means doing nothing, unless prompted by your Guru.
You step, so to say, aside and let your Guru live your life. You merely
watch and wonder how easily he solves the problems which to you
seemed insoluble.
<!--l. 9825--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As I sit here, I see the room, the people. I see you too. How does it
look at your end? What do you see?
<!--l. 9827--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing. I look, but I do not see in the sense of creating images
clothed with judgements. I do not describe nor evaluate. I look, I see
you, but neither attitude nor opinion cloud my vision. And when I turn
my eyes away, my mind does not allow memory to linger; it is at once
free and fresh for the next impression.
<!--l. 9829--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As I am here, looking at you, I cannot locate the event in
space and time. There is something eternal and universal about
the transmission of wisdom that is taking place. Ten thousand
years earlier, or later, make no difference &#8211; the event itself is
timeless.
<!--l. 9831--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Man does not change much over the ages. Human problems remain
the same and call for the same answers. Your being conscious of what
you call transmission of wisdom shows that wisdom has not yet been
transmitted. When you have it, you are no longer conscious of it. What
is really your own, you are not conscious of. What you are conscious of
is neither you nor yours. Yours is the power of perception, not what
you perceive. It is a mistake to take the conscious to be the whole of
man. Man is the unconscious, conscious and the super-conscious, but

you are not the man.
<!--l. 9833--><p class="noindent" >Yours is the cinema screen, the light as well as the seeing power, but
the picture is not you.
<!--l. 9835--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must I search for the Guru, or shall I stay with whomever I have
found?
<!--l. 9837--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The very question shows that you have not yet found one. As long
as you have not realised, you will move from Guru to Guru, but
when you have found yourself, the search will end. A Guru is a
milestone. When you are on the move, you pass so many milestones.
When you have reached your destination, it is the last alone that
mattered. In reality all mattered at their own time and none matters
now.
<!--l. 9839--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You seem to give no importance to the Guru. He is merely an
incident among others.
<!--l. 9841--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All incidents contribute, but none is crucial. On the road each step
helps you reach your destination, and each is as crucial as the other, for
each step must be made, you cannot skip it. If you refuse to make it,
you are stuck!
<!--l. 9843--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Everybody sings the glories of the Guru, while you compare him to
a milestone. Don&#8217;t we need a Guru?
<!--l. 9845--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t we need a milestone? Yes and no. Yes, if we are uncertain, no
if we know our way. Once we are certain in ourselves, the Guru is
no longer needed, except in a technical sense. Your mind is an
instrument, after all, and you should know how to use it. As you are
taught the uses of your body, so you should know how to use your
mind.

<!--l. 9847--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What do I gain by learning to use my mind?
<!--l. 9849--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You gain freedom from desire and fear, which are entirely
due to wrong uses of the mind. Mere mental knowledge is not
enough. The known is accidental, the unknown is the home of the
real. To live in the known is bondage, to live in the unknown is
liberation.
<!--l. 9851--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have understood that all spiritual practice consists in the
elimination of the personal self. Such practice demands iron
determination and relentless application. Where to find the integrity
and energy for such work?
<!--l. 9853--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You find it in the company of the wise?
<!--l. 9855--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How do I know who is wise and who is merely clever?
<!--l. 9857--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If your motives are pure, if you seek truth and nothing else,
you will find the right people. Finding them is easy, what is
difficult is to trust them and take full advantage of their advice and
guidance.
<!--l. 9859--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is the waking state more important for spiritual practice than
sleep?
<!--l. 9861--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>On the whole we attach too much importance, to the waking state.
Without sleep the waking state would be impossible; without sleep one
goes mad or dies; why attach so much importance to waking
consciousness, which is obviously dependent on the unconscious? Not
only the conscious but the unconscious as well should be taken care of
in our spiritual practice.
<!--l. 9863--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one attend to the unconscious?

<!--l. 9865--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Keep the &#8216;I am&#8217; in the focus of awareness, remember that you are,
watch yourself ceaselessly and the unconscious will flow into the
conscious without any special effort on your part. Wrong desires and
fears, false ideas, social inhibitions are blocking and preventing its
free interplay with the conscious. Once free to mingle, the two
become one and the one becomes all. The person merges into
the witness, the witness into awareness, awareness into pure
being, yet identity is not lost, only its limitations are lost. It is
transfigured, and becomes the real Self, the sadguru, the eternal
friend and guide. You cannot approach it in worship. No external
activity can reach the inner self; worship and prayers remain
on the surface only; to go deeper meditation is essential, the
striving to go beyond the states of sleep, dream and waking. In the
beginning the attempts are irregular, then they recur more often,
become regular, then continuous and intense, until all obstacles are
conquered.
<!--l. 9867--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Obstacles to what?
<!--l. 9869--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To self-forgetting.
<!--l. 9871--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If worship and prayers are ineffectual why do you worship daily,
with songs and music, the image of your Guru!
<!--l. 9873--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Those who want it, do it. I see no purpose in interfering.
<!--l. 9875--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But you take part in it.
<!--l. 9877--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, it appears so. But why be so concerned with me? Give all your
attention to the question:
<!--l. 9879--><p class="noindent" >&#8216;What is it that makes me conscious?&#8217;, until your mind becomes the
question itself and cannot think of anything else.

<!--l. 9881--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All and sundry are urging me to meditate. I find no zest in
meditation, but I am interested in many other things; some I want very
much and my mind goes to them; my attempts at meditation are so
half-hearted. What am I to do?
<!--l. 9883--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Ask yourself: &#8216;To whom it all happens?&#8217; Use everything as an
opportunity to go within. Light your way by burning up obstacles in
the intensity of awareness. When you happen to desire or fear, it is not
the desire or fear that are wrong and must go, but the person who
desires and fears. There is no point in fighting desires and fears which
may be perfectly natural and justified; It is the person, who is swayed
by them, that is the cause of mistakes, past and future. The person
should be carefully examined and its falseness seen; then its power over
you will end. After all, it subsides each time you go to sleep.
In deep sleep you are not a self-conscious person, yet you are
alive.
<!--l. 9885--><p class="noindent" >When you are alive and conscious, but no longer self-conscious, you are
not a person anymore.
<!--l. 9887--><p class="noindent" >During the waking hours you are, as if, on the stage, playing a
role, but what are you when the play is over? You are what you
are; what you were before the play began you remain when it is
over.
<!--l. 9889--><p class="noindent" >Look at yourself as performing on the stage of life. The performance
may be splendid or clumsy, but you are not in it, you merely watch it;
with interest and sympathy, of course, but keeping in mind all the
time that you are only watching while the play &#8211; life &#8211; is going
on.
<!--l. 9891--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You are always stressing the cognition aspect of reality. You hardly
ever mention affection, and will &#8211; never?

<!--l. 9893--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Will, affection, bliss, striving and enjoying are so deeply tainted
with the personal, that they cannot be trusted. The clarification and
purification needed at the very start of the journey, only awareness can
give. Love and will shall have their turn, but the ground must be
prepared. The sun of awareness must rise first &#8211; all else will
follow.

then I returned to the every-day consciousness.

thing very flimsy and short-lived; when the building is ready, the
scaffolding will be dismantled and removed. The &#8216;I am&#8217; and the &#8216;What

Consciousness is not all. So many things happen beyond its reach. To

wrong.
<!--l. 9915--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 9919--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Be careful. The moment you start talking you create a verbal
universe, a universe of words, ideas, concepts and abstractions,
interwoven and inter-dependent, most wonderfully generating,
supporting and explaining each other and yet all without essence or
substance, mere creations of the mind. Words create words, reality is
silent.
<!--l. 9921--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 9923--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That you hear is a fact. What you hear &#8211; is not. The fact can be
experienced, and in that sense the sound of the word and the mental
ripples it causes are experienced. There is no other reality behind it. Its
meaning is purely conventional, to be remembered; a language can be
easily forgotten, unless practiced.
<!--l. 9925--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 9927--><p class="noindent" ><span

Words do not convey facts, they signal them. Once you are beyond the

consciousness?
<!--l. 9931--><p class="noindent" ><span

three states &#8211; sleeping, dreaming and waking are all in consciousness,
the manifested; what you call unconsciousness will also be manifested &#8211;

realise it as a fact, to go beyond into the changeless, wordless
Reality?

happens in and to the mind, not to the source of the &#8216;I am&#8217;. Once you

depends on how the words are out together, but there must be
somebody to put them together &#8211; meaningfully. By drawing words at

random the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavata could never be
produced. The theory of accidental emergence is not tenable. The
origin of the meaningful must be beyond it. What is the power
that creates order out of chaos? Living is more than being, and
consciousness is more than living. Who is the conscious living
being?
<!--l. 9989--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your question contains the answer: a conscious living being is a
conscious living being. The words are most appropriate, but you do not
grasp their full import. Go deep into the meaning of the words: being,
living, conscious, and you will stop running in circles, asking
questions, but missing answers. Do understand that you cannot ask a
valid question about yourself, because you do not know whom
you are asking about. In the question &#8216;Who am I?&#8217; the &#8216;I&#8217; is
not known and the question can be worded as: &#8220;I do not know
what I mean by &#8216;I&#8217;&#8221; What you are, you must find out. I can
only tell you what you are not. You are not of the world, you
are not even in the world. The world is not, you alone are. You
create the world in your imagination like a dream. As you cannot
separate the dream from yourself, so you cannot have an outer
world independent of yourself. You are independent, not the
world. Don&#8217;t be afraid of a world you yourself have created. Cease
from looking for happiness and reality in a dream and you will
wake up. You need not know &#8216;why&#8217; and &#8216;how&#8217;, there is no end to
questions. Abandon all desires, keep your mind silent and you shall
discover.

<!--l. 9993--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>Do you experience the three states of waking, dreaming
and sleeping just as we do, or otherwise?
<!--l. 9995--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>All the three states are sleep to me. My waking state is
beyond them. As I look at you, you all seem asleep, dreaming up words
of your own. I am aware, for I imagine nothing. It is not samadhi which
is but a kind of sleep. It is just a state unaffected by the mind,
free from the past and future. In your case it is distorted by
desire and fear, by memories and hopes; in mine it is as it is
&#8211;
<!--l. 9997--><p class="noindent" >normal. To be a person is to be asleep.
<!--l. 9999--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Between the body and pure awareness stands the &#8216;inner organ&#8217;,
antahkarana, the &#8216;subtle body&#8217;, the &#8216;mental body&#8217;, whatever the name.
Just as a whirling mirror converts sunlight into a manifold pattern of
streaks and colours, so does the subtle body convert the simple light of
the shining Self into a diversified world. Thus I have understood your
teaching. What I cannot grasp is how did this subtle body arise in the
first instance?
<!--l. 10001--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is created with the emergence of the &#8216;I am&#8217; idea. The two are
one.
<!--l. 10003--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How did the &#8216;I am&#8217; appear?
<!--l. 10005--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In your world everything must have a beginning and an end. If it
does not, you call it eternal. In my view there is no such thing as
beginning or end &#8211; these are all related to time. Timeless being is
entirely in the now.
<!--l. 10007--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The antahkarana, or the &#8216;subtle body&#8217;, is it real or unreal?

<!--l. 10009--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is momentary. Real when present, unreal when over.
<!--l. 10011--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What kind of reality? Is it momentary?
<!--l. 10013--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Call it empirical, or actual, or factual. It is the reality of
immediate experience, here and now, which cannot be denied. You can
question the description and the meaning, but not the event
itself.
<!--l. 10015--><p class="noindent" >Being and non-being alternate and their reality is momentary.
The Immutable Reality lies beyond space and time. Realise the
momentariness of being and non-being and be free from both.
<!--l. 10017--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Things may be transient, yet they are very much with us, in endless
repetition.
<!--l. 10019--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Desires are strong. It is desire that causes repetition. There is no
recurrence where desire is not.
<!--l. 10021--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What about fear?
<!--l. 10023--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Desire is of the past, fear is of the future. The memory of past
suffering and the fear of its recurrence make one anxious about the
future.
<!--l. 10025--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is also fear of the unknown.
<!--l. 10027--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Who has not suffered is not afraid.
<!--l. 10029--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are condemned to fear?
<!--l. 10031--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Until we can look at fear and accept it as the shadow of
personal existence, as persons we are bound to be afraid. Abandon
all personal equations and you shall be free from fear. It is not

difficult.
<!--l. 10033--><p class="noindent" >Desirelessness comes on its own when desire is recognised as false. You
need not struggle with desire. Ultimately, it is an urge to happiness,
which is natural as long as there is sorrow. Only see that there is no
happiness in what you desire.
<!--l. 10035--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We settle for pleasure.
<!--l. 10037--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Each pleasure is wrapped in pain. You soon discover that you
cannot have one without the other.
<!--l. 10039--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is the experiencer and there is his experience. What created
the link between the two?
<!--l. 10041--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing created it. It is. The two are one.
<!--l. 10043--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I feel there is a catch somewhere, but I do not know where.
<!--l. 10045--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The catch is in your mind, which insists on seeing duality where
there is none.
<!--l. 10047--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As I listen to you, my mind is all in the now and I am astonished to
find myself without questions.
<!--l. 10049--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can know reality only when you are astonished.
<!--l. 10051--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can make out that the cause of anxiety and fear is memory. What
are the means for putting an end to memory?
<!--l. 10053--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t talk of means, there are no means. What you see as false,
dissolves. It is the very nature of illusion to dissolve on investigation.
Investigate &#8211; that is all. You cannot destroy the false, for you are
creating it all the time. Withdraw from it, ignore it, go beyond, and it

will cease to be.
<!--l. 10055--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Christ also speaks of ignoring evil and being child-like.
<!--l. 10057--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Reality is common to all. Only the false is personal.
<!--l. 10059--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As I watch the sadhakas and enquire into the theories by which they
live, I find they have merely replaced material cravings by &#8216;spiritual&#8217;
ambitions. From what you tell us it looks as if the words: &#8216;spiritual&#8217; and
&#8216;ambition&#8217; are incompatible. If &#8216;spirituality&#8217; implies freedom from
ambition, what will urge the seeker on? The Yogis speak of the
desire for liberation as essential. Is it not the highest form of
ambition?
<!--l. 10061--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Ambition is personal, liberation is from the personal. In liberation
both the subject and the object of ambition are no longer. Earnestness
is not a yearning for the fruits of one&#8217;s endeavours. It is an expression
of an inner shift of interest away from the false, unessential, the
personal.
<!--l. 10063--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You told us the other day that we cannot even dream of perfection
before realisation, for the Self is the source of all perfection and not the
mind. If it is not excellence in virtue that is essential for liberation,
then what is?
<!--l. 10065--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Liberation is not the result of some means skilfully applied, nor of
circumstances. It is beyond the causal process. Nothing can compel it,
nothing can prevent it.
<!--l. 10067--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then why are we not free here and now?
<!--l. 10069--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But we are free &#8216;here and now&#8217;. It is only the mind that imagines
bondage.

<!--l. 10071--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What will put an end to imagination?
<!--l. 10073--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why should you want to put an end to it? Once you know your
mind and its miraculous powers, and remove what poisoned it &#8211; the
idea of a separate and isolated person &#8211; you just leave it alone to do its
work among things to which it is well suited. To keep the mind
in its own place and on its own work is the liberation of the
mind.
<!--l. 10075--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the work of the mind?
<!--l. 10077--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The mind is the wife of the heart and the world their home &#8211; to be
kept bright and happy.
<!--l. 10079--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have not yet understood why, if nothing stands in the way of
liberation, it does not happen here and now.
<!--l. 10081--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing stands in the way of your liberation and it can happen
here and now, but for your being more interested in other things. And
you cannot fight with your interests. You must go with them, see
through them and watch them reveal themselves as mere errors of
judgement and appreciation.
<!--l. 10083--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Will it not help me if I go and stay with some great and holy
man?
<!--l. 10085--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Great and holy people are always within your reach, but you do not
recognise them. How will you know who is great and holy? By hearsay?
Can you trust others in these matters, or even yourself? To convince
you beyond the shadow of doubt you need more than a commendation,
more even than a momentary rapture. You may come across a great
and holy man or women and not even know for a long time your good
fortune. The infant son of a great man for many years will not know
the greatness of his father. You must mature to recognise greatness and

purify your heart for holiness. Or you will spend your time and
money in vain and also miss what life offers you. There are good
people among your friends &#8211; you can learn much from them.
Running after saints is merely another game to play. Remember
yourself instead and watch your daily life relentlessly. Be earnest,
and you shall not fail to break the bonds of inattention and
imagination.
<!--l. 10087--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you want me to struggle all alone?
<!--l. 10089--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are never alone. There are powers and presences who serve you
all the time most faithfully. You may or may not perceive them,
nevertheless they are real and active. When you realise that all is in
your mind and that you are beyond the mind, that you are truly alone;
then all is you.
<!--l. 10091--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is omniscience? Is God omniscient? Are you omniscient? We
hear the expression &#8211;
<!--l. 10093--><p class="noindent" >universal witness. What does it mean? Does self-realisation imply
omniscience? Or is it a matter of specialised training?
<!--l. 10095--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To lose entirely all interest in knowledge results in omniscience. It
is but the gift of knowing what needs to be known, at the right
moment, for error-free action. After all, knowledge is needed for action
and if you act rightly, spontaneously, without bringing in the conscious,
so much the better.
<!--l. 10097--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can one know the mind of another person?
<!--l. 10099--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Know you own mind first. It contains the entire universe and with
space to spare!
<!--l. 10101--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Your working theory seems to be that the waking state is

not basically different from dream and the dreamless sleep. The
three states are essentially a case of mistaken self-identification
with the body. Maybe it is true, but, I feel, it is not the whole
truth.
<!--l. 10103--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Do not try to know the truth, for knowledge by the mind is not
true knowledge. But you can know what is not true &#8211; which is enough
to liberate you from the false. The idea that you know what is true is
dangerous, for it keeps you imprisoned in the mind. It is when you do
not know, that you are free to investigate. And there can be no
salvation, without investigation, because non-investigation is the main
cause of bondage.
<!--l. 10105--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You say that the illusion of the world begins with the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;,
but when I ask about the origin of the sense &#8216;I am&#8217;, you answer that it
has no origin, for on investigation it dissolves. What is solid
enough to build the world on cannot be mere illusion. The &#8216;I am&#8217;
is the only changeless factor I am conscious of; how can it be
false?
<!--l. 10107--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not the &#8216;I am&#8217; that is false, but what you take yourself to be. I
can see, beyond the least shadow of doubt, that you are not
what you believe yourself to be. Logic or no logic, you cannot
deny the obvious. You are nothing that you are conscious of.
Apply yourself diligently to pulling apart the structure you have
built in your mind. What the mind has done the mind must
undo.
<!--l. 10109--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You cannot deny the present moment, mind or no mind. What is
now, is. You may question the appearance, but not the fact. What is at
the root of the fact?
<!--l. 10111--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The &#8216;I am&#8217; is at the root of all appearance and the permanent link
in the succession of events that we call life; but I am beyond the &#8216;I

am&#8217;.
<!--l. 10113--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have found that the realised people usually describe their state in
terms borrowed from their religion. You happen to be a Hindu, so you
talk of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and use Hindu approaches and
imagery. Kindly tell us, what is the experience behind your words?
What reality do they refer to?
<!--l. 10115--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is my way of talking, a language I was taught to use.
<!--l. 10117--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But what is behind the language?
<!--l. 10119--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can I put it into words, except in negating them? Therefore, I
use words like timeless, spaceless, causeless. These too are words, but
as they are empty of meaning, they suit my purpose.
<!--l. 10121--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If they are meaningless, why use them?
<!--l. 10123--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Because you want words where no words apply.
<!--l. 10125--><p class="noindent" ><span

 id="x1-9400089"></a>Progress in Spiritual Life</h2>
<!--l. 10128--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>We are two girls from England, visiting India.
We know little about Yoga and we are here because we were
told that spiritual teachers play an important role in Indian
life.
<!--l. 10130--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You are welcome. There is nothing new you will find
here. The work we are doing is timeless. It was the same ten
thousand years ago. Centuries roll on, but the human problem
does not change &#8211; the problem of suffering and the ending of
suffering.
<!--l. 10132--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The other day seven young foreigners have turned up asking for a
place to sleep for a few nights. They came to see their Guru who was
lecturing in Bombay. I met him &#8211; a very pleasant looking young man is
he &#8211; apparently very matter-of-fact and efficient, but with an
atmosphere of peace and silence about him. His teaching is traditional
with stress on karma Yoga, selfless work, service of the Guru etc.
Like the Gita, he says that selfless work will result in salvation.
He is full of ambitious plans: training workers who will start
spiritual centres in many countries. It seems he gives them not
only the authority, but also the power to do the work in his
name.
<!--l. 10134--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, there is such a thing as transmission of power.
<!--l. 10136--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I was with them I had a strange feeling of becoming invisible.
The devotees, in their surrender to their Guru surrendered me
also! Whatever I did for them was their Guru&#8217;s doing and I was
not considered, except as a mere instrument. I was merely a
tap to turn left or right. There was no personal relationship
whatsoever. They tried a little to convert me to their faith; as soon as
they felt resistance, they just dropped me from the field of their

attention. Even between themselves they did not appear very
much related; it is their common interest in their Guru that
kept them together. I found it rather cold, almost inhuman. To
consider oneself an instrument in God&#8217;s hands is one thing; to be
denied all attention and consideration because &#8216;all is God&#8217; may
lead to indifference verging on cruelty. After all, all wars are
made &#8216;in the name of God&#8217;. The entire history of mankind is
a succession of &#8216;holy wars&#8217;. One is never so impersonal as in
war!
<!--l. 10138--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To insist, to resist, are contained in the will to be. Remove the will
to be and what remains?
<!--l. 10140--><p class="noindent" >Existence and non-existence relate to something in space and time;
here and now, there and then, which again are in the mind. The mind
plays a guessing game; it is ever uncertain; anxiety-ridden and restless.
You resent being treated as a mere instrument of some god, or Guru,
and insist on being treated as a person, because you are not sure of
your own existence and do not want to give up the comfort and
assurance of a personality. You may not be what you believe yourself to
be, but it gives you continuity, your future flows into the present and
becomes the past without jolts. To be denied personal existence is
frightening, but you must face it and find your identity with the
totality of life. Then the problem of who is used by whom is no
more.
<!--l. 10142--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All the attention I got was an attempt to convert me to their faith.
When I resisted they lost all interest in me.
<!--l. 10144--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>One does not become a disciple by conversion, or by accident.
There is usually an ancient link, maintained through many lives and
flowering as love and trust, without which there is no discipleship.
<!--l. 10146--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What made you decide to become a teacher?

<!--l. 10148--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I was made into one by being called so. Who am I to teach and
whom? What I am, you are, and what you are &#8211; I am. The &#8216;I am&#8217; is
common to us all; beyond the &#8216;I am&#8217; there is the immensity of light and
love. We do not see it because we look elsewhere; I can only point at
the sky; seeing of the star is your own work. Some take more time
before they see the star, some take less; it depends on the clarity of
their vision and their earnestness in search. These two must be their
own &#8211; I can only encourage.
<!--l. 10150--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What am I expected to do when I become a disciple?
<!--l. 10152--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Each teacher has his own method, usually patterned on his Guru&#8217;s
teachings and on the way he himself has realised, and his own
terminology as well. Within that framework adjustments to the
personality of the disciple are made. The disciple is given full
freedom of thought and enquiry and encouraged to question to his
heart&#8217;s content. He must be absolutely certain of the standing and
competence of his Guru, otherwise his faith will not be absolute nor his
action complete. It is the absolute in you that takes you to the
absolute beyond you &#8211; absolute truth, love selflessness are the
decisive factors in self-realisation. With earnestness these can be
reached.
<!--l. 10154--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I understand one must give up one&#8217;s family and possessions to
become a disciple.
<!--l. 10156--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It varies with the Guru. Some expect their mature disciples to
become ascetics and recluses; some encourage family life and duties.
Most of them consider a model family life more difficult than
renunciation, suitable for a personality more mature and better
balanced. At the early stages the discipline of monastic life may be
advisable. Therefore, in the Hindu culture students up to the age of 25
are expected to live like monks &#8211; in poverty, chastity and obedience &#8211;
to give them a chance to build a character able to meet the hardships

and temptations of married life.
<!--l. 10158--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who are the people in this room? Are they your disciples?
<!--l. 10160--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Ask them. It is not on the verbal level that one becomes a disciple,
but in the silent depths of one&#8217;s being. You do not become a disciple by
choice; it is more a matter of destiny than self-will. It does not matter
much who is the teacher &#8211; they all wish you well. It is the disciple that
matters &#8211; his honesty and earnestness. The right disciple will always
find the right teacher.
<!--l. 10162--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can see the beauty and feel the blessedness of a life devoted to
search for truth under a competent and loving teacher. Unfortunately,
we have to return to England.
<!--l. 10164--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Distance does not matter. If your desires are strong and true, they
will mould your life for their fulfilment. Sow you seed and leave it to
the seasons.
<!--l. 10166--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What are the signs of progress in spiritual life?
<!--l. 10168--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10172--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is the simple that is certain, not the complicated. Somehow,
people do not trust the simple, the easy, the always available. Why not
give an honest trial to what I say? It may look very small and
insignificant, but it is like a seed that grows into a mighty tree. Give
yourself a chance!
<!--l. 10190--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I see so many people sitting here &#8211; quietly. What for have they
come?
<!--l. 10192--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To meet themselves. At home the world is too much with them.
Here nothing disturbs them; they have a chance to take leave of their
daily worries and contact the essential in themselves.
<!--l. 10194--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the course of training in self-awareness?
<!--l. 10196--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no need of training. Awareness is always with you. The
same attention that you give to the outer, you turn to the inner. No
new, or special kind of awareness is needed.

<!--l. 10198--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you help people personally?
<!--l. 10200--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>People come to discuss their problems. Apparently they derive
some help, or they would not come.
<!--l. 10202--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are the talks with people always in public, or will you talk to them
privately also?
<!--l. 10204--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is according to their wish. Personally, I make no distinction
between public and private.
<!--l. 10206--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you always available, or have you other work to do?
<!--l. 10208--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am always available, but the hours in the morning and late
afternoon are the most convenient.
<!--l. 10210--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I understand that no work ranks higher than the work of a spiritual
teacher.
<!--l. 10212--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10216--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I was born in the United States, and the last fourteen
months I have spent in Sri Ramanashram; now I am on my way back to
the States where my mother is expecting me.
<!--l. 10218--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>What are your plans?
<!--l. 10220--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I may qualify as a nurse, or just marry and have babies.
<!--l. 10222--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What makes you want to marry?
<!--l. 10224--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>providing a spiritual home is the highest form of social service I can
think of. But, of course, life may shape otherwise. I am ready for
whatever comes.
<!--l. 10226--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>These fourteen months at Sri Ramanashram, what did they give
you? In what way are you different from what you were when you
arrived there?
<!--l. 10228--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am no longer afraid. I have found some peace.
<!--l. 10230--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What kind of peace is it? The peace of having what you want, or
not wanting what you do not have?
<!--l. 10232--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A little of both, I believe. It was not easy at all. While the Ashram
is a very peaceful place, inwardly I was in agonies.
<!--l. 10234--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you realise that the distinction between inner and outer is in
the mind only, you are no longer afraid.
<!--l. 10236--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Such realisation comes and goes with me. I have not yet reached the
immutability of absolute completeness.

<!--l. 10238--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Well, as long as you believe so, you must go on with your sadhana,
to disperse the false idea of not being complete. Sadhana removes the
super-impositions. When you realise yourself as less than a point in
space and time, something too small to be cut and too short-lived to be
killed, then, and then only, all fear goes. When you are smaller than
the point of a needle, then the needle cannot pierce you &#8211; you pierce
the needle!
<!--l. 10240--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, that is how I feel sometimes &#8211; indomitable. I am more than
fearless &#8211; I am fearlessness itself.
<!--l. 10242--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What made you go to the Ashram?
<!--l. 10244--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I had an unhappy love affair and suffered hell. Neither drink
nor drugs could help me. I was groping and came across some
books on Yoga. From book to book, from clue to clue &#8211; I came to
Ramanashram.
<!--l. 10246--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Were the same tragedy to happen to you again, would you suffer as
much, considering your present state of mind?
<!--l. 10248--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Oh no, I would not let myself suffer again. I would kill myself.
<!--l. 10250--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So you are not afraid to die!
<!--l. 10252--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am afraid of dying, not of death itself. I imagine the dying process
to be painful and ugly.
<!--l. 10254--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How do you know? It need not be so. It may be beautiful and
peaceful. Once you know that death happens to the body and not
to you, you just watch your body falling off like a discarded
garment.
<!--l. 10256--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am fully aware that my fear of death is due to apprehension and

not knowledge.
<!--l. 10258--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Human beings die every second, the fear and the agony of dying
hangs over the world like a cloud. No wonder you too are afraid. But
once you know that the body alone dies and not the continuity of
memory and the sense of &#8216;I am&#8217; reflected in it, you are afraid no
longer.
<!--l. 10260--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Well, let us die and see.
<!--l. 10262--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Give attention and you will find that birth and death are one, that
life pulsates between being and non-being, and that each needs the
other for completeness. You are born to die and you die to be
reborn.
<!--l. 10264--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does not detachment stop the process?
<!--l. 10266--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>With detachment the fear goes, but not the fact.
<!--l. 10268--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Shall I be compelled to be reborn? How dreadful!
<!--l. 10270--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no compulsion. You get what you want. You make your
own plans and you carry them out.
<!--l. 10272--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do we condemn ourselves to suffer?
<!--l. 10274--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>We grow through investigation, and to investigate we need
experience. We tend to repeat what we have not understood. If we are
sensitive and intelligent, we need not suffer. Pain is a call for attention
and the penalty of carelessness. Intelligent and compassionate action is
the only remedy.
<!--l. 10276--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is because I have grown in intelligence that I would not tolerate
my suffering again. What is wrong with suicide?

<!--l. 10278--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing wrong, if it solves the problem. What, if it does not?
Suffering caused by extraneous factors &#8211; some painful and incurable
disease, or unbearable calamity &#8211; may provide some justification, but
where wisdom and compassion are lacking, suicide cannot help.
A foolish death means foolishness reborn. Besides there is the
question of karma to consider. Endurance is usually the wisest
course.
<!--l. 10280--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must one endure suffering, however acute and hopeless?
<!--l. 10282--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Endurance is one thing and helpless agony is another. Endurance is
meaningful and fruitful, while agony is useless.
<!--l. 10284--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why worry about karma? It takes care of itself anyhow.
<!--l. 10286--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Most of our karma is collective. We suffer for the sins of others, as
others suffer for ours.
<!--l. 10288--><p class="noindent" >Humanity is one. Ignorance of this fact does not change it. We could
have been much happier people ourselves, but for our indifference to
the sufferings of others.
<!--l. 10290--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find I have grown much more responsive.
<!--l. 10292--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Good. When you say it, what do you have in mind? Yourself, as a
responsive person within a female body?
<!--l. 10294--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is a body and there is compassion and there is memory and a
number of things and attitudes; collectively they may be called a
person.
<!--l. 10296--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Including the &#8216;I am&#8217; idea?
<!--l. 10298--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The &#8216;I am&#8217; is like a basket that holds the many things that make a

person.
<!--l. 10300--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Or, rather, it is the willow of which the basket is woven. When you
think of yourself as a women, do you mean that you are a women, or
that your body is described as female?
<!--l. 10302--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It depends on my mood. Sometimes I feel myself to be a mere
centre of awareness.
<!--l. 10304--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Or, an ocean of awareness. But are there moments when you
are neither man nor women, not the accidental, occasioned by
circumstances and conditions?
<!--l. 10306--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, there are, but I feel shy to talk about it.
<!--l. 10308--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A hint is all that one can expect. You need not say more.
<!--l. 10310--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Am I allowed to smoke in your presence? I know that it is not the
custom to smoke before a sage and more so for a women.
<!--l. 10312--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means, smoke, nobody will mind. We understand.
<!--l. 10314--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I feel the need of cooling down.
<!--l. 10316--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is very often so with Americans and Europeans. After a stretch
of sadhana they become charged with energy and frantically seek an
outlet. They organise communities, become teachers of Yoga, marry,
write books &#8211; anything except keeping quiet and turning their energies
within, to find the source of the inexhaustible power and learn the art
of keeping it under control.
<!--l. 10318--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I admit that now I want to go back and live a very active life,
because I feel full of energy.

<!--l. 10320--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can do what you like, as long as you do not take yourself to be
the body and the mind. It is not so much a question of actual giving up
the body and all that goes with it, as a clear understanding
that you are not the body. A sense of aloofness, of emotional
non-involvement.
<!--l. 10322--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I know what you mean. Some four years ago I passed through
a period of rejection of the physical; I would not buy myself
clothes, would eat the simplest foods, sleep on bare planks. It is
the acceptance of the privations that matters, not the actual
discomfort. Now I have realised that welcoming life as it comes and
loving all it offers, is best of it. I shall accept with glad heart
whatever comes and make the best of it. If I can do nothing
more than give life and true culture to a few children &#8211; good
enough; though my heart goes out to every child, I cannot reach
all.
<!--l. 10324--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are married and a mother only when you are man-women
conscious. When you do not take yourself to be the body, then the
family life of the body, however intense and interesting, is seen only as
a play on the screen of the mind, with the light of awareness as the
only reality.
<!--l. 10326--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why do you insist on awareness as the only real? Is not the object
of awareness as real, while it lasts?
<!--l. 10328--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But it does not last! Momentary reality is secondary; it depends on
the timeless.
<!--l. 10330--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you mean continuous, or permanent?
<!--l. 10332--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There can be no continuity in existence. Continuity implies identity
in past, present and future.

<!--l. 10334--><p class="noindent" >No such identity is possible, for the very means of identification
fluctuate and change. Continuity, permanency, these are illusions
created by memory, mere mental projections of a pattern where no
pattern can be; Abandon all ideas of temporary or permanent, body or
mind, man or women; what remains? What is the state of your mind
when all separation is given up? I am not talking of giving up
distinctions, for without them there is no manifestation.
<!--l. 10336--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I do not separate, I am happily at peace. But somehow I
lose my bearings again and again and begin to seek happiness
in outer things. Why is my inner peace not steady, I cannot
understand.
<!--l. 10338--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Peace, after all, is also a condition of the mind.
<!--l. 10340--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Beyond the mind is silence. There is nothing to be said about
it.
<!--l. 10342--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, all talk about silence is mere noise.
<!--l. 10344--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why do we seek worldly happiness, even after having tasted one&#8217;s
own natural spontaneous happiness?
<!--l. 10346--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When the mind is engaged in serving the body, happiness is lost.
To regain it, it seeks pleasure.
<!--l. 10348--><p class="noindent" >The urge to be happy is right, but the means of securing it are
misleading, unreliable and destructive of true happiness.
<!--l. 10350--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is pleasure always wrong?
<!--l. 10352--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The right state and use of the body and the mind are intensely
pleasant. It is the search for pleasure that is wrong. Do not try to make
yourself happy, rather question your very search for happiness. It is

because you are not happy that you want to be happy. Find out why
you are unhappy. Because you are not happy you seek happiness in
pleasure; pleasure brings in pain and therefore you call it worldly; you
then long for some other pleasure, without pain, which you call divine.
In reality, pleasure is but a respite from pain. Happiness is both worldly
and unworldly, within and beyond all that happens. Make no
distinction, don&#8217;t separate the inseparable and do not alienate yourself
from life.
<!--l. 10354--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How well I understand you now! Before my stay at Ramanashram I
was tyrannised by conscience, always sitting in judgement of myself.
Now I am completely relaxed, fully accepting myself as I am. When I
return to the States, I shall take life as it comes, as Bhagavan&#8217;s grace,
and enjoy the bitter along with the sweet. This is one of the things I
have learnt in the Ashram &#8211; to trust Bhagavan. I was not like this
before. I could not trust.
<!--l. 10356--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Trusting Bhagavan is trusting yourself. Be aware that whatever
happens, happens to you, by you, through you, that you are the
creator, enjoyer and destroyer of all you perceive and you will not be
afraid. Unafraid, you will not be unhappy, nor will you seek
happiness.
<!--l. 10358--><p class="noindent" >In the mirror of your mind all kinds of pictures appear and disappear.
Knowing that they are entirely your own creations, watch them silently
come and go, be alert, but not perturbed. This attitude of silent
observation is the very foundation of Yoga. You see the picture, but
you are not the picture.
<!--l. 10360--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find that the thought of death frightens me because I do not want
to be reborn. I know that none compels, yet the pressure of
unsatisfied desires is overwhelming and I may not be able to
resist.

<!--l. 10362--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The question of resistance does not arise. What is born and reborn
is not you. Let it happen, watch it happen.
<!--l. 10364--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Why then be at all concerned?
<!--l. 10366--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>But you are concerned! And you will be concerned as long as the
picture clashes with your own sense of truth, love and beauty. The
desire for harmony and peace is in eradicable. But once it is fulfilled,
the concern ceases and physical life becomes effortless and below the
level of attention.
<!--l. 10368--><p class="noindent" >Then, even in the body you are not born. To be embodied or bodyless
is the same to you. You reach a point when nothing can happen to you.
Without body, you cannot be killed; without possessions you cannot be
robbed; without mind, you cannot be deceived. There is no point where
a desire or fear can hook on. As long as no change can happen to you,
what else matters?
<!--l. 10370--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Somehow I do not like the idea of dying.
<!--l. 10372--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is because you are so young. The more you know yourself the less
you are afraid. Of course, the agony of dying is never pleasant to look
at, but the dying man is rarely conscious.
<!--l. 10374--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does he return to consciousness?
<!--l. 10376--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is very much like sleep. For a time the person is out of focus and
then it returns.
<!--l. 10378--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The same person?
<!--l. 10380--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The person, being a creature of circumstances, necessarily changes
along with them, like the flame that changes with the fuel. Only the
process goes on and on, creating time and space.

<!--l. 10382--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Well, God will look after me. I can leave everything to Him.
<!--l. 10384--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Even faith in God is only a stage on the way. Ultimately you
abandon all, for you come to something so simple that there are no
words to express it.
<!--l. 10386--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am just beginning. At the start I had no faith, no trust; I was
afraid to let things happen. The world seemed to be a very dangerous
and inimical place. Now, at least I can talk of trusting the Guru or
God. Let me grow. Don&#8217;t drive me on. Let me proceed at my own
pace.
<!--l. 10388--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means proceed. But you don&#8217;t. You are still stuck in the
ideas of man and women, old and young, life and death. Go on, go
beyond. A thing recognised is a thing transcended.
<!--l. 10390--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, wherever I go people take it to be their duty to find faults with
me and goad me on. I am fed up with this spiritual fortune making.
What is wrong with my present that it should be sacrificed to a future,
however glorious? You say reality is in the now. I want it. I do not want
to be eternally anxious about my stature and its future. I do
not want to chase the more and the better. Let me love what I
have.
<!--l. 10392--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are quite right; do it. Only be honest &#8211; just love what you love
&#8211; don&#8217;t strive and strain.
<!--l. 10394--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This is what I call surrender to the Guru.
<!--l. 10396--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why exteriorise? Surrender to your own self, of which everything is
an expression.

<!--l. 10399--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>A friend of mine, a young man about twenty-five,
was told that he is suffering from an incurable heart disease. He
wrote to me that instead of slow death he preferred suicide. I
replied to him that a disease incurable by Western medicine
may be cured in some other way. There are yogic powers that
can bring almost instantaneous changes in the human body.
Effects of repeated fasting also verge on the miraculous. I wrote to
him not to be in a hurry to die; rather to give a trial to other
approaches.
<!--l. 10401--><p class="noindent" >There is a Yogi living not far from Bombay who possesses some
miraculous powers. He has specialised in the control of the vital
forces governing the body. I met some of his disciples and sent
through to the Yogi my friend&#8217;s letter and photo. Let us see what
happens.
<!--l. 10403--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Yes, miracles often take place. But there must be the will to
live. Without it the miracles will not happen.
<!--l. 10405--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can such a desire be instilled?
<!--l. 10407--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Superficial desire, yes. But it will wear out. Fundamentally, nobody
can compel another to live.
<!--l. 10409--><p class="noindent" >Besides, there were cultures in which suicide had its acknowledged and
respected place.
<!--l. 10411--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is it not obligatory to live out one&#8217;s natural span of life?
<!--l. 10413--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Natural &#8211; spontaneously &#8211; easy &#8211; yes. But disease and suffering are
not natural. There is noble virtue in unshakable endurance of whatever
comes, but there is also dignity in the refusal of meaningless torture

and humiliation.
<!--l. 10415--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I was given a book written by a siddha. He describes in it many of
his strange, even amazing experiences. According to him the way of a
true sadhaka ends with his meeting his Guru and surrendering to him
body, mind and heart. Henceforth the Guru takes over and becomes
responsible for even the least event in the disciple&#8217;s life, until the two
become one. One may call it realisation through identification. The
disciple is taken over by a power he cannot control, nor resist, and feels
as helpless as a leaf in the storm. The only thing that keeps him safe
from madness and death is his faith in the love and power of his
Guru.
<!--l. 10417--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Every teacher teaches according to his own experience. Experience
is shaped by belief and belief is shaped by experience. Even the Guru is
shaped by the disciple to his own image. It is the disciple that makes
the Guru great. Once the Guru is seen to be the agent of a liberating
power, which works both from within and without, whole-hearted
surrender becomes natural and easy. Just as a man gripped by pain
puts himself completely in the hands of a surgeon, so does the
disciple entrust himself without reservation to his Guru. It is
quite natural to seek help when its need is felt acutely. But,
however powerful the Guru may be, he should not impose his
will on the disciple. On the other hand, a disciple that distrusts
and hesitates is bound to remain unfulfilled for no fault of his
Guru.
<!--l. 10419--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What happens then?
<!--l. 10421--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Life teaches, where all else fails. But the lessons of life take a long
time to come. Much delay and trouble is saved by trusting and obeying.
But such trust comes only when indifference and restlessness
give place to clarity and peace. A man who keeps himself in
low esteem, will not be able to trust himself, nor anybody else.

Therefore, in the beginning the teacher tries his best to reassure the
disciple as to his high origin, noble nature and glorious destiny. He
relates to him the experiences of some saints as well as his own,
instilling confidence in himself and in his infinite possibilities. When
self-confidence and trust in the teacher come together, rapid and
far-going changes in the disciple&#8217;s character and life can take
place.
<!--l. 10423--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I may not want to change. My life is good enough as it is.
<!--l. 10425--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You say so because you have not seen how painful is the life you
live. You are like a child sleeping with a lollypop in its mouth. You may
feel happy for a moment by being totally self-centred, but it
is enough to have a good look at human faces to perceive the
universality of suffering. Even your own happiness is so vulnerable and
short-lived, at the mercy of a bank-crash, or a stomach ulcer. It
is just a moment of respite, a mere gap between two sorrows.
Real happiness is not vulnerable, because it does not depend on
circumstances.
<!--l. 10427--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you talking from your own experience? Are you too unhappy?
<!--l. 10429--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I have no personal problems. But the world is full of living beings
whose lives are squeezed between fear and craving. They are like cattle
driven to the slaughter house, jumping and frisking, carefree and
happy, yet dead and skinned within an hour.
<!--l. 10431--><p class="noindent" >You say you are happy. Are you really happy, or are you merely trying
to convince yourself. Look at yourself fearlessly and you will
at once realise that your happiness depends on conditions and
circumstances, hence it is momentary, not real. Real happiness flows
from within.
<!--l. 10433--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Of what use is your happiness to me? It does not make me

happy.
<!--l. 10435--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You can have the whole of it and more for the mere asking. But
you do not ask; you don&#8217;t seem to want.
<!--l. 10437--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10439--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are quite satisfied with pleasures. There is no place for
happiness. Empty your cup and clean it. It cannot be filled otherwise.
Others can give you pleasure, but never happiness.
<!--l. 10441--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>A chain of pleasurable events is good enough.
<!--l. 10443--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Soon it ends in pain, if not in disaster. What is Yoga after all, but
seeking lasting happiness within?
<!--l. 10445--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You can speak only for the East. In the West the conditions are
different and what you say does not apply.
<!--l. 10447--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no East and West in sorrow and fear. The problem is
universal &#8211; suffering and the ending of suffering. The cause of suffering
is dependence and independence is the remedy. Yoga is the science and
the art of self-liberation through self-understanding.
<!--l. 10449--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do not think I am fit for Yoga.
<!--l. 10451--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What else are you fit for? All your going and coming, seeking
pleasure, loving and hating &#8211; all this shows that you struggle against
limitations, self-imposed or accepted. In your ignorance you make
mistakes and cause pain to yourself and others, but the urge is there
and shall not be denied.
<!--l. 10453--><p class="noindent" >The same urge that seeks birth, happiness and death shall seek
understanding and liberation. It is like a spark of fire in a cargo of

cotton. You may not know about it, but sooner or later the ship will
burst in flames. Liberation is a natural process and in the long
run, inevitable. But it is within your power to bring it into the
now.
<!--l. 10455--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then why are so few liberated people in the world?
<!--l. 10457--><p class="noindent" ><span

What will you do then?
<!--l. 10461--><p class="noindent" >Despair? All right, despair. You will get tired of despairing and
begin to question. At that moment you will be fit for conscious
Yoga.
<!--l. 10463--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10465--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yours is the naturalness of a born cripple. You may be unaware
but it does not make you normal. What it means to be natural
or normal you do not know, nor do you know that you do not
know.
<!--l. 10467--><p class="noindent" >At present you are drifting and therefore in danger, for to a drifter any
moment anything may happen. It would be better to wake up and see
your situation. That you are &#8211; you know. What you are &#8211; you don&#8217;t
know. Find out what you are.
<!--l. 10469--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10471--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10475--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10481--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>We are like animals, running about in vain pursuits and
there seems to be no end to it.
<!--l. 10483--><p class="noindent" >Is there a way out?
<!--l. 10485--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Many ways will be offered to you which will but take you
round and bring you back to your starting point. First realise that your
problem exists in your waking state only, that however painful it is, you
are able to forget it altogether when you go to sleep. When you are
awake you are conscious; when you are asleep, you are only alive.
Consciousness and life &#8211; both you may call God; but you are beyond
both, beyond God, beyond being and not-being. What prevents you
from knowing yourself as all and beyond all, is the mind based on
memory. It has power over you as long as you trust it; don&#8217;t struggle
with it; just disregard it. Deprived of attention, it will slow down
and reveal the mechanism of its working. Once you know its
nature and purpose, you will not allow it to create imaginary
problems.
<!--l. 10487--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, not all problems are imaginary. There are real problems.
<!--l. 10489--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What problems can there be which the mind did not create? Life
and death do not create problems; pains and pleasures come and go,
experienced and forgotten. It is memory and anticipation that create
problems of attainment or avoidance, coloured by like and dislike.
Truth and love are man&#8217;s real nature and mind and heart are the
means of its expression.
<!--l. 10491--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How to bring the mind under control? And the heart, which does
not know what it wants?
<!--l. 10493--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They cannot work in darkness. They need the light of pure

awareness to function rightly. All effort at control will merely subject
them to the dictates of memory. Memory is a good servant, but a bad
master. It effectively prevents discovery. There is no place for
effort in reality. It is selfishness, due to a self-identification with
the body, that is the main problem and the cause of all other
problems. And selfishness cannot be removed by effort, only by
clear insight into its causes and effects. Effort is a sign of conflict
between incompatible desires. They should be seen as they are
&#8211;
<!--l. 10495--><p class="noindent" >then only they dissolve.
<!--l. 10497--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And what remains?
<!--l. 10499--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>That which cannot change, remains. The great peace, the deep
silence, the hidden beauty of reality remain. While it can not be
conveyed through words, it is waiting for you to experience for
yourself.
<!--l. 10501--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must not one be fit and eligible for realisation? Our nature is
animal to the core. Unless it is conquered, how can we hope for reality
to dawn?
<!--l. 10503--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Leave the animal alone. Let it be. Just remember what you are.
Use every incident of the day to remind you that without you as the
witness there would be neither animal nor God. Understand that you
are both, the essence and the substance of all there is. and remain firm
in your understanding.
<!--l. 10505--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10507--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is your understanding that will decide about the validity of
proofs. But what more tangible proof do you need than your own
existence? Wherever you go you find yourself. However far you reach

out in time, you are there.
<!--l. 10509--><p class="noindent" ><span

now.
<!--l. 10511--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Good enough. The &#8216;here&#8217; is everywhere and the now &#8211; always. Go
beyond the &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217;
<!--l. 10513--><p class="noindent" >idea and you will find that space and time are in you and not you in
space and time. Once you have understood this, the main obstacle to
realisation is removed.
<!--l. 10515--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the realisation which is beyond understanding?
<!--l. 10517--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Imagine a dense forest full of tigers and you in a strong steel cage.
Knowing that you are well protected by the cage, you watch the tigers
fearlessly. Next you find the tigers in the cage and yourself roaming
about in the jungle. Last &#8211; the cage disappears and you ride the
tigers!
<!--l. 10519--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I attended one of the group meditation sessions, held recently in
Bombay, and witnessed the frenzy and self-abandon of the participants.
Why do people go for such things?
<!--l. 10521--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>These are all inventions of a restless mind pampering to people in
search of sensations. Some of them help the unconscious to disgorge
suppressed memories and longings and to that extent they provide
relief. But ultimately they leave the practitioner where he was &#8211; or
worse.
<!--l. 10523--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have read recently a book by a Yogi on his experiences in
meditation. It is full of visions and sounds, colours and melodies; quite
a display and a most gorgeous entertainment! In the end they all faded
out and only the feeling of utter fearlessness remained. No wonder &#8211; a

man who passed through all these experiences unscathed need not be
afraid of anything! Yet I was wondering of what use is such book to
me?
<!--l. 10525--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of no use, probably, since it does not attract you. Others may be
impressed. People differ. But all are faced with the fact of their own
existence. &#8216;I am&#8217; is the ultimate fact; &#8216;Who am l?&#8217; is the ultimate
question to which everybody must find an answer.
<!--l. 10527--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The same answer?
<!--l. 10529--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The same in essence, varied in expression.
<!--l. 10531--><p class="noindent" >Each seeker accepts, or invents, a method which suits him, applies it to
himself with some earnestness and effort, obtains results according to
his temperament and expectations, casts them into the mound of
words, builds them into a system, establishes a tradition and begins to
admit others into his &#8216;school of Yoga&#8217;. It is all built on memory
and imagination. No such school is valueless, nor indispensable;
in each one can progress up to the point, when all desire for
progress must be abandoned to make further progress possible.
Then all schools are given up, all effort ceases; in solitude and
darkness the vast step is made which ends ignorance and fear
forever.
<!--l. 10533--><p class="noindent" >The true teacher, however, will not imprison his disciple in a
prescribed set of ideas, feelings and actions; on the contrary, he will
show him patiently the need to be free from all ideas and set
patterns of behaviour, to be vigilant and earnest and go with life
wherever it takes him, not to enjoy or suffer, but to understand and
learn.
<!--l. 10535--><p class="noindent" >Under the right teacher the disciple learns to learn, not to remember
and obey. Satsang, the company of the noble, does not mould, it

liberates. Beware of all that makes you dependent. Most of the
so-called &#8216;surrenders to the Guru&#8217; end in disappointment, if not in
tragedy. Fortunately, an earnest seeker will disentangle himself in time,
the wiser for the experience.
<!--l. 10537--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely, self-surrender has its value.
<!--l. 10539--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Self-surrender is the surrender of all self-concern. It cannot
be done, it happens when you realise your true nature. Verbal
self-surrender, even when accompanied by feeling, is of little value and
breaks down under stress. At the best it shows an aspiration, not an
actual fact.
<!--l. 10541--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>In the Rigveda there is the mention of the adhi yoga, the Primordial
Yoga, consisting of the marriage of pragna with Prana, which, as I
understand, means the bringing together of wisdom and life. Would you
say it means also the union of Dharma and Karma, righteousness and
action?
<!--l. 10543--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, provided by righteousness you mean harmony with one&#8217;s true
nature and by action &#8211; only unselfish and desireless action.
<!--l. 10545--><p class="noindent" >In adhi yoga life itself is the Guru and the mind &#8211; the disciple. The
mind attends to life, it does not dictate. Life flows naturally
and effortlessly and the mind removes the obstacles to its even
flow.
<!--l. 10547--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not life by its very nature repetitive? Will not following life lead
to stagnation?
<!--l. 10549--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By itself life is immensely creative. A seed, in course of time,
becomes a forest. The mind is like a forester &#8211; protecting and
regulating the immense vital urge of existence.

<!--l. 10551--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Seen as the service of life by the mind, the adhi yoga is a
perfect democracy. Everyone is engaged in living a life to his
best capacity and knowledge, everyone is a disciple of the same
Guru.
<!--l. 10553--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You may say so. It may be so &#8211; potentially. But unless life is loved
and trusted, followed with eagerness and zest, it would be fanciful to
talk of Yoga, which is a movement in consciousness, awareness in
action.
<!--l. 10555--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Once I watched a mountain-stream flowing between the boulders.
At each boulder the commotion was different, according to the shape
and size of the boulder. Is not every person a mere commotion over a
body, while life is one and eternal?
<!--l. 10557--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The commotion and the water are not separate. It is the
disturbance that makes you aware of water. Consciousness is always of
movement, of change. There can be no such thing as changeless
consciousness. Changelessness wipes out consciousness immediately. A
man deprived of outer or inner sensations blanks out, or goes beyond
consciousness and unconsciousness into the birthless and deathless
state. Only when spirit and matter come together consciousness is
born.
<!--l. 10559--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are they one or two?
<!--l. 10561--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It depends on the words you use: they are one, or two, or three. On
investigation three become two and two become one. Take the simile of
face &#8211; mirror &#8211; image. Any two of them presuppose the third which
unites the two. In sadhana you see the three as two, until you realise
the two as one.
<!--l. 10563--><p class="noindent" >A long as you are engrossed in the world, you are unable to know
yourself: to know yourself, turn away your attention from the world and

turn it within.
<!--l. 10565--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I cannot destroy the world.
<!--l. 10567--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no need. Just understand that what you see is not what is.
Appearances will dissolve on investigation and the underlying reality
will come to the surface. You need not burn the house to get out of it.
You just walk out. It is only when you cannot come and go freely that
the house becomes a jail. I move in and out of consciousness easily
and naturally and therefore to me the world is a home, not a
prison.
<!--l. 10569--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But ultimately is there a world, or is there none?
<!--l. 10571--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What you see is nothing but your self. Call it what you like, it does
not change the fact. Through the film of destiny your own light
depicts pictures on the screen. You are the viewer, the light, the
picture and the screen. Even the film of destiny ( prarabdha) is
self-selected and self-imposed. The spirit is a sport and enjoys to
overcome obstacles. The harder the task the deeper and wider his
self-realisation.

<!--l. 10575--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>From the beginning of my life I am pursued by a sense of
incompleteness. From school to college, to work, to marriage, to
affluence, I imagined that the next thing will surely give me peace, but
there was no peace. This sense of unfulfillment keeps on growing as
years pass by.
<!--l. 10577--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>As long as there is the body and the sense of identity with
the body, frustration is inevitable. Only when you know yourself
as entirely alien to and different from the body, will you find
respite from the mixture of fear and craving inseparable from
the &#8216;I-am-the-body&#8217; idea. Merely assuaging fears and satisfying
desires will not remove this sense of emptiness you are trying to
escape from; only self-knowledge can help you. By self-knowledge I
mean full knowledge of what you are not. Such knowledge is
attainable and final; but to the discovery of what you are there can
be no end. The more you discover, the more there remains to
discover.

<!--l. 10581--><p class="noindent" ><span

self-realisation.
<!--l. 10587--><p class="noindent" ><span

quiet.
<!--l. 10589--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10591--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I just let things happen, how can I be sure that they will happen
my way? Surely I must bend them to my desire.
<!--l. 10593--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your desire just happens to you along with its fulfilment, or
non-fulfilment. You can change neither. You may believe that you exert
yourself, strive and struggle. Again, it all merely happens, including
the fruits of the work. Nothing is by you and for you. All is in
the picture exposed on the cinema screen, nothing in the light,
including what you take yourself to be, the person. You are the light
only.
<!--l. 10595--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10597--><p class="noindent" ><span

forget and then remember.

<!--l. 10603--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Exactly. Freedom is freedom from worry. Having realised that you
cannot influence the results, pay no attention to your desires and fears.
Let them come and go. Don&#8217;t give them the nourishment of interest
and attention.
<!--l. 10605--><p class="noindent" ><span

and see. You need not be anxious: &#8216;What next?&#8217; There is always the
next. Life does not begin nor, end: immovable &#8211; it moves, momentary &#8211;
it lasts. Light can not be exhausted even if innumerable pictures are

<!--l. 10613--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You want to treat the disease without having seen the patient!
Before you ask about ignorance, why don&#8217;t you enquire first, who is the
ignorant? When you say you are ignorant, you do not know that you
have imposed the concept of ignorance over the actual state of your
thoughts and feelings.
<!--l. 10615--><p class="noindent" >Examine them as they occur, give them your full attention and you will
find that there is nothing like ignorance, only inattention. Give
attention to what worries you, that is all. After all, worry is mental
pain and pain is invariably a call for attention. The moment you give
attention, the call for it ceases and the question of ignorance dissolves.
Instead of waiting for an answer to your question, find out who is
asking the question and what makes him ask it. You will soon
find that it is the mind, goaded by fear of pain, that asks the
question. And in fear there is memory and anticipation, past
and future. Attention brings you back to the present, the now,
and the presence in the now is a state ever at hand, but rarely
noticed.
<!--l. 10617--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You are reducing sadhana to simple attention. How is it that other
teachers teach complete, difficult and time-consuming courses?
<!--l. 10619--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The Gurus usually teach the sadhanas by which they themselves

have reached their goal, whatever their goal may be. This is but
natural, for their own sadhana they know intimately. I was taught to
give attention to my sense of &#8216;I am&#8217; and I found it supremely effective.
Therefore, I can speak of it with full confidence. But often people come
with their bodies, brain and minds so mishandled, perverted and weak,
that the state of formless attention is beyond them. In such
cases, some simpler token of earnestness is appropriate. The
repetition of a mantra, or gazing at a picture will prepare their body
and mind for a deeper and more direct search. After all, it is
earnestness that is indispensable, the crucial factor. Sadhana is
only a vessel and it must be filled to the brim with earnestness,
which is but love in action. For nothing can be done without
love.
<!--l. 10621--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We love only ourselves.
<!--l. 10623--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Were it so, it would be splendid! Love your self wisely and you will
reach the summit of perfection. Everybody loves his body, but few love
their real being.
<!--l. 10625--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does my real being need my love?
<!--l. 10627--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your real being is love itself and your many loves are its reflections
according to the situation at the moment.
<!--l. 10629--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>We are selfish, we know only self-love.
<!--l. 10631--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Good enough for a start. By all means wish yourself well. Think
over, feel out deeply what is really good for you and strive for
it earnestly. Very soon you will find that the real is your only
good.
<!--l. 10633--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yet I do not understand why the various Gurus insist on
prescribing complicated and difficult sadhanas. Don&#8217;t they know

better?
<!--l. 10635--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not what you do, but what you stop doing that matters. The
people who begin their sadhana are so feverish and restless, that they
have to be very busy to keep themselves on the track. An absorbing
routine is good for them. After some time they quieten down and turn
away from effort. In peace and silence the skin of the &#8216;I&#8217; dissolves
and the inner and the outer become one. The real sadhana is
effortless.
<!--l. 10637--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have sometimes the feeling that space itself is my body.
<!--l. 10639--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When you are bound by the illusion: &#8216;I am this body&#8217;, you
are merely a point in space and a moment in time. When the
self-identification with the body is no more, all space and time are in
your mind, which is a mere ripple in consciousness, which is awareness
reflected in nature. Awareness and matter are the active and
the passive aspects of pure being, which is in both and beyond
both.
<!--l. 10641--><p class="noindent" >Space and time are the body and the mind of the universal existence.
My feeling is that all that happens in space and time happens to me,
that every experience is my experience every form is my form. What I
take myself to be, becomes my body and all that happens to that body
becomes my mind. But at the root of the universe there is pure
awareness, beyond space and time, here and now. Know it to be your
real being and act accordingly.
<!--l. 10643--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What difference will it make in action what I take myself to be.
Actions just happen according to circumstances.
<!--l. 10645--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Circumstances and conditions rule the ignorant. The knower
of reality is not compelled. The only law he obeys is that of
love.


<h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">Chapter&#x00A0;94</span><br /><a
 id="x1-9900094"></a>You are Beyond Space and Time</h2>
<!--l. 10649--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>You keep on saying that I was never born and will never
die. If so, how is it that I see the world as one which has been born and
will surely die?
<!--l. 10651--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You believe so because you have never questioned your
belief that you are the body which, obviously, is born and dies. While
alive, it attracts attention and fascinates so completely that
rarely does one perceive one&#8217;s real nature. It is like seeing the
surface of the ocean and completely forgetting the immensity
beneath. The world is but the surface of the mind and the mind is
infinite.
<!--l. 10653--><p class="noindent" >What we call thoughts are just ripples in the mind. When the mind
is quiet it reflects reality. When it is motionless through and
through, it dissolves and only reality remains. This reality is
so concrete, so actual, so much more tangible than mind and
matter, that compared to it even diamond is soft like butter.
This overwhelming actuality makes the world dreamlike, misty,
irrelevant.
<!--l. 10655--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This world, with so much suffering in it, how can you see it as
irrelevant. What callousness!
<!--l. 10657--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is you who is callous, not me. If your world is so full of suffering,
do something about it; don&#8217;t add to it through greed or indolence. I am
not bound by your dreamlike world. In my world the seeds of suffering,
desire and fear are not sown and suffering does not grow. My world is
free from opposites, of mutually distinctive discrepancies; harmony
pervades; its peace is rocklike; this peace and silence are my
body.
<!--l. 10659--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What you say reminds me of the dharmakaya of the Buddha.

<!--l. 10661--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Maybe. We need not run off with terminology. Just see the person
you imagine yourself to be as a part of the world you perceive within
your mind and look at the mind from the outside, for you are not the
mind. After all, your only problem is the eager self-identification with
whatever you perceive.
<!--l. 10663--><p class="noindent" >Give up this habit, remember that you are not what you perceive, use
your power of alert aloofness.
<!--l. 10665--><p class="noindent" >See yourself in all that lives and your behaviour will express your
vision. Once you realise that there is nothing in this world, which you
can call your own, you look at it from the outside as you look at a play
on the stage, or a picture on the screen, admiring and enjoying, but
really unmoved. As long as you imagine yourself to be something
tangible and solid, a thing among things, actually existing in time and
space, short-lived and vulnerable, naturally you will be anxious to
survive and increase.
<!--l. 10667--><p class="noindent" >But when you know yourself as beyond space and time &#8211; in contact
with them only at the point of here and now, otherwise all-pervading
and all-containing, unapproachable, unassailable, invulnerable &#8211; you
will be afraid no longer. Know yourself as you are &#8211; against fear there is
no other remedy.
<!--l. 10669--><p class="noindent" >You have to learn to think and feel on these lines, or you will remain
indefinitely on the personal level of desire and fear, gaining and losing,
growing and decaying. A personal problem cannot be solved on its own
level. The very desire to live is the. messenger of death, as the longing
to be happy is the outline of sorrow. The world is an ocean of pain and
fear, of anxiety and despair.
<!--l. 10671--><p class="noindent" >Pleasures are like the fishes, few and swift, rarely come, quickly gone. A
man of low intelligence believes, against all evidence, that he is an
exception and that the world owes him happiness. But the world

cannot give what it does not have; unreal to the core, it is of no use for
real happiness. It cannot be otherwise. We seek the real because we are
unhappy with the unreal. Happiness is our real nature and we shall
never rest until we find it. But rarely we know where to seek it.
Once you have understood that the world is but a mistaken view
of reality, and is not what it appears to be, you are free of its
obsessions. Only what is compatible with your real being can
make you happy and the world, as you perceive it, is its outright
denial.
<!--l. 10673--><p class="noindent" >Keep very quiet and watch what comes to the surface of the mind.
Reject the known, welcome the so far unknown and reject it in its turn.
Thus you come to a state in which there is no knowledge, only
being, in which being itself is knowledge. To know by being is
direct knowledge. It is based on the identity of the seer and the
seen. Indirect knowledge is based on sensation and memory, on
proximity of the perceiver and his percept, confined with the
contrast between the two. The same with happiness. Usually
you have to be sad to know gladness and glad to know sadness.
True happiness is uncaused and this cannot disappear for lack of
stimulation. It is not the opposite of sorrow, it includes all sorrow and
suffering.
<!--l. 10675--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can one remain happy among so much suffering?
<!--l. 10677--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>One cannot help it &#8211; the inner happiness is overwhelmingly real.
Like the sun in the sky, its expressions may be clouded, but it is never
absent.
<!--l. 10679--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When we are in trouble, we are bound to be unhappy.
<!--l. 10681--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Fear is the only trouble. Know yourself as independent and you will
be free from fear and its shadows.

<!--l. 10683--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the difference between happiness and pleasure?
<!--l. 10685--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pleasure depends on things, happiness does not.
<!--l. 10687--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If happiness is independent, why are we not always happy?
<!--l. 10689--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as we believe that we need things to make us happy, we
shall also believe that in their absence we must be miserable. Mind
always shapes itself according to its beliefs. Hence the importance of
convincing oneself that one need not be prodded into happiness;
that, on the contrary, pleasure is a distraction and a nuisance,
for it merely increases the false conviction that one needs to
have and do things to be happy when in reality it is just the
opposite.
<!--l. 10691--><p class="noindent" >But why talk of happiness at all? You do not think of happiness except
when you are unhappy. A man who says: &#8216;Now I am happy&#8217;, is between
two sorrows &#8211; past and future. This happiness is mere excitement
caused by relief from pain. Real happiness is utterly unselfconscious. It
is best expressed negatively as: &#8216;there is nothing wrong with me. I
have nothing to worry about&#8217;. After all, the ultimate purpose of
all sadhana is to reach a point, when this conviction, instead
of being only verbal, is based on the actual and ever-present
experience.
<!--l. 10693--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Which experience?
<!--l. 10695--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The experience of being empty, uncluttered by memories and
expectations; it is like the happiness of open spaces, of being young, of
having all the time and energy for doing things, for discovery, for
adventure.
<!--l. 10697--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What remains to discover?

<!--l. 10699--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The universe without and the immensity within as they are in
reality, in the great mind and heart of God. The meaning and
purpose of existence, the secret of suffering, life&#8217;s redemption from
ignorance.
<!--l. 10701--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If being happy is the same as being free from fear and worry, cannot
it be said that absence of trouble is the cause of happiness?
<!--l. 10703--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A state of absence, of non-existence cannot be a cause; the
pre-existence of a cause is implied in the notion. Your natural state, in
which nothing exists, cannot be a cause of becoming; the causes are
hidden in the great and mysterious power of memory. But your true
home is in nothingness, in emptiness of all content.
<!--l. 10705--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Emptiness and nothingness &#8211; how dreadful!
<!--l. 10707--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You face it most cheerfully, when you go to sleep! Find out for
yourself the state of wakeful sleep and you will find it quite in
harmony with your real nature. Words can only give you the idea
and the idea is not the experience. All I can say is that true
happiness has no cause and what has no cause is immovable.
Which does not mean it is perceivable, as pleasure. What is
perceivable is pain and pleasure; the state of freedom from sorrow
can be described only negatively. To know it directly you must
go beyond the mind addicted to causality and the tyranny of
time.
<!--l. 10709--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If happiness is not conscious and consciousness &#8211; not happy, what is
the link between the two?
<!--l. 10711--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness being a product of conditions and circumstances,
depends on them and changes along with them. What is independent,
uncreated, timeless and changeless, and yet ever new and fresh, is
beyond the mind. When the mind thinks of it, the mind dissolves and

only happiness remains.
<!--l. 10713--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When all goes, nothingness remains.
<!--l. 10715--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can there be nothing without something? Nothing is only an
idea, it depends on the memory of something. Pure being is quite
independent of existence, which is definable and describable.
<!--l. 10717--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Please tell us; beyond the mind does consciousness continue, or does
it end with the mind?
<!--l. 10719--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Consciousness comes and goes, awareness shines immutably.
<!--l. 10721--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who is aware in awareness?
<!--l. 10723--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>When there is a person, there is also consciousness. &#8216;I am&#8217; mind,
consciousness denote the same state. If you say &#8216;I am aware&#8217;, it only
means: &#8216;I am conscious of thinking about being aware&#8217;.
<!--l. 10725--><p class="noindent" >There is no &#8216;I am&#8217; in awareness.
<!--l. 10727--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What about witnessing?
<!--l. 10729--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Witnessing is of the mind. The witness goes with the witnessed. In
the state of non-duality all separation ceases.
<!--l. 10731--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What about you? Do you continue in awareness?
<!--l. 10733--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The person, the &#8216;I am this body, this mind, this chain of memories,
this bundle of desires and fears&#8217; disappears, but something you may
call identity, remains. It enables me to become a person when
required. Love creates its own necessities, even of becoming a
person.

<!--l. 10735--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is said that Reality manifests itself as existence &#8211; consciousness &#8211;
bliss. Are they absolute or relative?
<!--l. 10737--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They are relative to each other and depend on each other. Reality
is independent of its expressions.
<!--l. 10739--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the relation between reality and its expressions?
<!--l. 10741--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>No relation. In reality all is real and identical. As we put it, saguna
and nirguna are one in Parabrahman. There is only the Supreme. In
movement, it Is saguna. Motionless, it is nirguna. But it is only the
mind that moves or does not move. The real is beyond, you are beyond.
Once you have understood that nothing perceivable, or conceivable can
be yourself, you are free of your imaginations. To see everything as
imagination, born of desire, is necessary for self-realisation. We miss
the real by lack of attention and create the unreal by excess of
imagination.
<!--l. 10743--><p class="noindent" >You have to give your heart and mind to these things and brood over
them repeatedly. It is like cooking food. You must keep it on the fire for
some time before it is ready.
<!--l. 10745--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Am I not under the sway of destiny, of my karma? What can I do
against it? What I am and what I do is pre-determined. Even my
so-called free choice is predetermined; only I am not aware of it and
imagine myself to be free.
<!--l. 10747--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Again, it all depends how you look at it. Ignorance is like a fever &#8211;
it makes you see things which are not there. karma is the divinely
prescribed treatment. Welcome it and follow the instructions faithfully
and you will get well. A patient will leave the hospital after he recovers.
To insist on immediate freedom of choice and action will merely
postpone recovery. Accept your destiny and fulfil it &#8211; this is the
shortest way to freedom from destiny, though not from love and its

compulsions. To act from desire and fear is bondage, to act from love is
freedom.

<!--l. 10761--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 10769--><p class="noindent" ><span

inevitable?
<!--l. 10773--><p class="noindent" ><span

immense earnestness. At every moment whatever comes to you

imagination and desire, that gives you trouble.

compelled to live?
<!--l. 10785--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are accepting it anyhow. The sorrows of others do not interfere
with your pleasures. If you were really compassionate, you would have
abandoned long ago all self-concern and entered the state from which

alone you can really help.
<!--l. 10787--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I have a big house and enough land, I may create an Ashram,
with individual rooms; common meditation hall, canteen, library, office
etc.
<!--l. 10789--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Ashrams are not made, they happen. You cannot start nor prevent
them, as you cannot start or stop a river. Too many factors are
involved in the creation of a successful Ashram and your inner
maturity is only one of them. Of course, if you are ignorant of your
real being, whatever you do must turn to ashes. You cannot

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you take yourself to be a person, a body and a mind,
separate from the stream of life, having a will of its own, pursuing its
own aims, you are living merely on the surface and whatever you do
will be short-lived and of little value, mere straw to feed the flames of
vanity. You must put in true worth before you can expect something

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I admit it is courage that I lack.
<!--l. 10813--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is because you are not fully convinced. Complete conviction
generates both desire and courage. And meditation is the art of
achieving faith through understanding. In meditation you consider the
teaching received, in all its aspects and repeatedly, until out of clarity
confidence is born and, with confidence, action. Conviction and action
are inseparable. If action does not follow conviction, examine your
convictions, don&#8217;t accuse yourself of lack of courage. Self-depreciation
will take you nowhere. Without clarity and emotional assent of what
use is will?

comes from love &#8211; you must love to act &#8211; whatever the shape and
object of your love. Without clarity and charity courage is destructive.

People at war are often wonderfully courageous, but what of
it?
<!--l. 10819--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I see quite clearly that all I want is a house in a garden where I
shall live in peace. Why should I not act on my desire?
<!--l. 10821--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means, act. But do not forget the inevitable, unexpected.
Without rain your garden will not flourish. You need courage for
adventure.
<!--l. 10823--><p class="noindent" ><span

action.
<!--l. 10825--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The entire approach is wrong. Action delayed is action abandoned.
There may be other chances for other actions, but the present moment
is lost &#8211; irretrievably lost. All preparation is for the future &#8211; you cannot
prepare for the present.
<!--l. 10827--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is wrong with preparing for the future?
<!--l. 10829--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Acting in the now is not much helped by your preparations. Clarity
is now, action is now.
<!--l. 10831--><p class="noindent" >Thinking of being ready impedes action. And action is the touchstone
of reality.
<!--l. 10833--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Even when we act without conviction?
<!--l. 10835--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You cannot live without action, and behind each action there is
some fear or desire. Ultimately, all you do is based on your conviction
that the world is real and independent of yourself. Were you
convinced of the contrary, your behaviour would have been quite
different.

<!--l. 10837--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There is nothing wrong with my convictions; my actions are shaped
by circumstances.
<!--l. 10839--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In other words, you are convinced of the reality of your circumstances,
of the world in which you live. Trace the world to its source and you
will find that before the world was, you were and when the world is no
longer, you remain. Find your timeless being and your action will bear
it testimony.
<!--l. 10841--><p class="noindent" >Did you find it?
<!--l. 10843--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No, I did not.
<!--l. 10845--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Then what else have you to do? Surely, this is the most urgent
task. You cannot see yourself as independent of everything unless you
drop everything and remain unsupported and undefined.
<!--l. 10847--><p class="noindent" >Once you know yourself, it is immaterial what you do, but to realise
your independence, you must test it by letting go all you were
dependent on. The realised man lives on the level of the absolutes; his
wisdom, love and courage are complete, there is nothing relative about
him. Therefore he must prove himself by tests more stringent, undergo
trials more demanding. The tester, the tested and the set up for
testing are all within; it is an inner drama to which none can be a
party.
<!--l. 10849--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Crucifixion, death and resurrection &#8211; we are on familiar grounds! I
have read, heard and talked about it endlessly, but to do it I find
myself incapable.
<!--l. 10851--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Keep quiet, undisturbed, and the wisdom and the power will come
on their own. You need not hanker. Wait in silence of the heart and
mind. It is very easy to be quiet, but willingness is rare. You people
want to become supermen overnight. Stay without ambition, without

the least desire, exposed, vulnerable, unprotected, uncertain and alone,
completely open to and welcoming life as it happens, without the
selfish conviction that all must yield you pleasure or profit, material or
so-called spiritual.
<!--l. 10853--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I respond to what you say, but I just do not see how it is
done.
<!--l. 10855--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you know how to do it, you will not do it. Abandon every
attempt, just be; don&#8217;t strive, don&#8217;t struggle, let go every support,
hold on to the blind sense of being, brushing off all else. This is
enough.
<!--l. 10857--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is this brushing done? The more I brush off, the more it comes
to the surface.
<!--l. 10859--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Refuse attention, let things come and go. Desires and thoughts are
also things. Disregard them.
<!--l. 10861--><p class="noindent" >Since immemorial time the dust of events was covering the clear mirror
of your mind, so that only memories you could see. Brush off the dust
before it has time to settle; this will lay bare the old layers until the
true nature of your mind is discovered. It is all very simple and
comparatively easy; be earnest and patient, that is all. Dispassion,
detachment, freedom from desire and fear, from all self-concern, mere
awareness &#8211; free from memory and expectation &#8211; this is the state of
mind to which discovery can happen. After all, liberation is but the
freedom to discover.

class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I am an American by birth and for the last one year I
was staying in an Ashram in Madhya Pradesh, studying Yoga in its
many aspects. We had a teacher, whose Guru, a disciple of the great
Sivananda Saraswati, stays in Monghyr. I stayed at Ramanashram
also. While in Bombay I went through an intensive course of
Burmese meditation managed by one Goenka. Yet I have not found
peace. There is an improvement in self-control and day-to-day
discipline, but that is all. I cannot say exactly what caused what.
I visited many holy places. How each acted on me, I cannot
say.
<!--l. 10866--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Good results will come, sooner or later. At Sri Ramanashram
did you get some instructions?
<!--l. 10868--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, some English people were teaching me and also an Indian
follower of jnana yoga, residing there permanently, was giving me
lessons.
<!--l. 10870--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What are your plans?
<!--l. 10872--><p class="noindent" ><span

intend to complete my B.Sc., study Nature Cure and make it my
profession.
<!--l. 10874--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A good profession, no doubt.
<!--l. 10876--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there any danger in pursuing the path of Yoga at all cost?
<!--l. 10878--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Is a match-stick dangerous when the house is on fire? The search
for reality is the most dangerous of all undertakings for it will destroy
the world in which you live. But if your motive is love of truth and life,
you need not be afraid.

<!--l. 10880--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am afraid of my own mind. It is so unsteady!
<!--l. 10882--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In the mirror of your mind images appear and disappear.
The mirror remains. Learn to distinguish the immovable in the
movable, the unchanging in the changing, till you realise that all
differences are in appearance only and oneness is a fact. This
basic identity &#8211; you may call God, or Brahman, or the matrix (
Prakriti), the words matters little &#8211; is only the realisation that all is
one.
<!--l. 10884--><p class="noindent" >Once you can say with confidence born from direct experience: &#8216;I am
the world, the world is myself&#8217;, you are free from desire and fear
on one hand and become totally responsible for the world on
the other. The senseless sorrow of mankind becomes your sole
concern.
<!--l. 10886--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So even a jnani has his problems!
<!--l. 10888--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, but they are no longer of his own creation. His suffering is not
poisoned by a sense of guilt.
<!--l. 10890--><p class="noindent" >There is nothing wrong with suffering for the sins of others. Your
Christianity is based on this.
<!--l. 10892--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is not all suffering self-created?
<!--l. 10894--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, as long as there is a separate self to create it. In the end you
know that there is no sin, no guilt, no retribution, only life in its
endless transformations. With the dissolution of the personal
&#8216;I&#8217;
<!--l. 10896--><p class="noindent" >personal suffering disappears. What remains is the great sadness of
compassion, the horror of the unnecessary pain.

<!--l. 10898--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there anything unnecessary in the scheme of things?
<!--l. 10900--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nothing is necessary, nothing is inevitable. Habit and passion blind
and mislead.
<!--l. 10902--><p class="noindent" >Compassionate awareness heals and redeems. There is nothing
we can do, we can only let things happen according to their
nature.
<!--l. 10904--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you advocate complete passivity?
<!--l. 10906--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Clarity and charity is action. Love is not lazy and clarity directs.
You need not worry about action, look after your mind and heart.
Stupidity and selfishness are the only evil.
<!--l. 10908--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is better &#8211; repetition of God&#8217;s name, or meditation?
<!--l. 10910--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Repetition will stabilise your breath. With deep and quiet
breathing vitality will improve, which will influence the brain and help
the mind to grow pure and stable and fit for meditation. Without
vitality little can be done, hence the importance of its protection and
increase. Posture and breathing are a part of Yoga, for the body must
be healthy and well under control, but too much concentration on the
body defeats its own purpose, for it is the mind that is primary in the
beginning.
<!--l. 10912--><p class="noindent" >When the mind has been put to rest and disturbs no longer the inner
space ( chidakash), the body acquires a new meaning and its

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have been wandering all over India, meeting many Gurus and
learning in driblets several Yogas. Is it all right to have a taste of

everything?
<!--l. 10918--><p class="noindent" ><span

you find your own way.
<!--l. 10920--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I feel that the Guru of my own choice can not be my real Guru. To
be real he must come unexpected and be irresistible.
<!--l. 10922--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Not to anticipate is best. The way you respond is decisive.

<!--l. 10926--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Discrimination and dispassion practised now will yield their fruits

are sure to be sweet. Be pure, be alert, keep ready.
<!--l. 10928--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are austerities and penances of any use?
<!--l. 10930--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To meet all the vicissitudes of life is penance enough! You need not
invent trouble. To meet cheerfully whatever life brings is all the
austerity you need.
<!--l. 10932--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What about sacrifice?
<!--l. 10934--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Share willingly and gladly all you have with whoever needs &#8211; don&#8217;t
invent self-inflicted cruelties.

<!--l. 10940--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I feel I am too weak to stand on my own legs. I need the holy
company of a Guru and of good people. Equanimity is beyond me. To
accept what comes as it comes, frightens me. I think of my returning to

the States with horror.
<!--l. 10942--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Go back and make the best use of your opportunities. Get your
B.Sc. degree first. You can always return to India for your Nature Cure
studies.
<!--l. 10944--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am quite aware of the opportunities in the States. It is the
loneliness that frightens me.
<!--l. 10946--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have always the company of your own self &#8211; you need not feel
alone. Estranged from it even in India you will feel lonely. All
happiness comes from pleasing the self. Please it, after return to
the States, do nothing that may be unworthy of the glorious
reality within your heart and you shall be happy and remain
happy. But you must seek the self and, having found it, stay with
it.
<!--l. 10948--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Will compete solitude be of any benefit?
<!--l. 10950--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It depends on your temperament. You may work with others and
for others, alert and friendly, and grow more fully than in solitude,
which may make you dull or leave you at the mercy of your mind&#8217;s
endless chatter. Do not imagine that you can change through effort.
Violence, even turned against yourself, as in austerities and penance,
will remain fruitless.
<!--l. 10952--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there no way of making out who is realised and who is
not?
<!--l. 10954--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your only proof is in yourself. If you find that you turn to gold, it
will be a sign that you have touched the philosopher&#8217;s stone. Stay with
the person and watch what happens to you. Don&#8217;t ask others.
Their man may not be your Guru. A Guru may be universal
in his essence, but not in his expressions. He may appear to

be angry or greedy or over-anxious about his Ashram or his
family, and you may be misled by appearances, while others are
not.
<!--l. 10956--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Have I not the right to expect all-round perfection, both inner and
outer?
<!--l. 10958--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Inner &#8212; yes. But outer perfection depends on circumstances, on
the state of the body, personal and social, and other innumerable
factors.
<!--l. 10960--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I was told to find a jnani so that I may learn from him the art of
achieving jnana and now I am told that the entire approach is false,
that I cannot make out a jnani, nor can jnana be conquered by
appropriate means. It is all so confusing!
<!--l. 10962--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is all due to your complete misunderstanding of reality. Your
mind is steeped in the habits of evaluation and acquisition and will not
admit that the incomparable and unobtainable are waiting timelessly
within your own heart for recognition. All you have to do is to abandon
all memories and expectations. Just keep yourself ready in utter
nakedness and nothingness.
<!--l. 10964--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Who is to do the abandoning?
<!--l. 10966--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>God will do it. Just see the need of being abandoned. Don&#8217;t resist,
don&#8217;t hold on to the person you take yourself to be. Because you
imagine yourself to be a person you take the jnani to be a person too,
only somewhat different, better informed and more powerful. You may
say that he is eternally conscious and happy, but it is far from
expressing the whole truth. Don&#8217;t trust definitions and descriptions &#8211;
they are grossly misleading.
<!--l. 10968--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Unless I am told what to do and how to do it, I feel lost.

<!--l. 10970--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means do feel lost! As long as you feel competent and
confident, reality is beyond your reach. Unless you accept inner
adventure as a way of life, discovery will not come to you.
<!--l. 10972--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Discovery of what?
<!--l. 10974--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of the centre of your being, which is free of all directions, all means
and ends.

<!--l. 10978--><p class="noindent" ><span

know the way at least.
<!--l. 10982--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You must find your own way. Unless you find it yourself it
will not be your own way and will take you nowhere. Earnestly
live your truth as you have found it &#8211; act on the little you have
understood.
<!--l. 10984--><p class="noindent" >It is earnestness that will take you through, not cleverness &#8211; your own
or another&#8217;s.

of them.
<!--l. 10988--><p class="noindent" ><span

earnest.

<!--l. 10992--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>At least that much you know. Knowing them to be superficial, give

no value to your experiences, forget them as soon as they are over. Live
a clean, selfless life, that is all.
<!--l. 10994--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is morality so important?
<!--l. 10996--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Don&#8217;t cheat, don&#8217;t hurt &#8211; is it not important? Above all you need
inner peace &#8211; which demands harmony between the inner and the
outer. Do what you believe in and believe in what you do. All else is a
waste of energy and time.

<!--l. 11002--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>We are called collectively the &#8216;Nine Masters&#8217;. The legend
says that our first teacher was Rishi Dattatreya, the great incarnation
of the Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Even the &#8216;Nine Masters&#8217; (
Navnath) are mythological.
<!--l. 11004--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is the peculiarity of their teaching?
<!--l. 11006--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11008--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How does one become a Navnath? By initiation or by succession?
<!--l. 11010--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Neither. The &#8216;Nine Masters&#8217; tradition, Navnath Parampara, is like
a river &#8211; it flows into the ocean of reality and whoever enters it is
carried along.
<!--l. 11012--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does it imply acceptance by a living master belonging to the same
tradition?
<!--l. 11014--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Those who practise the sadhana of focussing their minds on &#8216;I am&#8217;
may feel related to others who have followed the same sadhana and
succeeded. They may decide to verbalise their sense of kinship by
calling themselves Navnaths. It gives them the pleasure of belonging to
an established tradition.
<!--l. 11016--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do they in any way benefit by joining?
<!--l. 11018--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The circle of satsang, the &#8216;company of saints&#8217;, expands in numbers
as time passes.

<!--l. 11020--><p class="noindent" ><span

they would have been barred otherwise?
<!--l. 11022--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Power and grace are for all and for the asking. Giving oneself a
particular name does not help.
<!--l. 11024--><p class="noindent" >Call yourself by any name &#8211; as long as you are intensely mindful of

Navnath?
<!--l. 11028--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Please your word-addicted mind! The name will not change you. At
best it may remind you to behave. There is a succession of Gurus and
their disciples, who in turn train more disciples and thus the
line is maintained. But the continuity of tradition is informal
and voluntary. It is like a family name, but here the family is
spiritual.
<!--l. 11030--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Do you have to realise to join the Sampradaya?
<!--l. 11032--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The Navnath Sampradaya is only a tradition, a way of teaching
and practice. It does not denote a level of consciousness. If you accept a
Navnath Sampradaya teacher as your Guru, you join his Sampradaya.
Usually you receive a token of his grace &#8211; a look, a touch, or a word,
sometimes a vivid dream or a strong remembrance. Sometimes the only
sign of grace is a significant and rapid change in character and
behaviour.
<!--l. 11034--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I know you now for some years and I meet you regularly. The
thought of you is never far from my mind. Does it make me belong to
your Sampradaya?

<!--l. 11036--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your belonging is a matter of your own feeling and conviction.
After all, it is all verbal and formal. In reality there is neither Guru nor
disciple, neither theory nor practice, neither ignorance nor realisation.
It all depends on what you take yourself to be. Know yourself correctly.
There is no substitute to self-knowledge.

<!--l. 11040--><p class="noindent" ><span

will dawn on you suddenly, when the obstacles are removed to some
extent. It is like a frayed rope snapping. Yours is to work at the
strands. The break is bound to happen. It can be delayed, but not
prevented.
<!--l. 11042--><p class="noindent" ><span

something or somebody solely responsible for all that happens. There is
a contradiction between a multiple universe and a single cause. Either
one or the other must be false. Or both. As I see it, it is all
day-dreaming. There is no reality in ideas. The fact is that without
you, neither the universe nor its cause could have come into
being.
<!--l. 11046--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I cannot make out whether I am the creature or the creator of the
universe.
<!--l. 11048--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>&#8216;I am&#8217; is an ever-present fact, while &#8216;I am created&#8217; is an idea.
Neither God nor the universe have come to tell you that they have
created you. The mind obsessed by the idea of causality invents
creation and then wonders &#8216;who is the creator?&#8217; The mind itself is
the creator. Even this is not quite true, for the created and its
creator are one. The mind and the world are not separate. Do

understand that what you think to be the world is your own
mind.
<!--l. 11050--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is there a world beyond, or outside the mind?
<!--l. 11052--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All space and time are in the mind. Where will you locate a
supramental world? There are many levels of the mind and each
projects its own version, yet all are in the mind and created by the
mind.
<!--l. 11054--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is your attitude to sin? How do you look at a sinner,
somebody who breaks the law, inner or outer? Do you want him to
change or you just pity him? Or, are you indifferent to him because of
his sins?
<!--l. 11056--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I know no sin, nor sinner. Your distinction and valuation do not
bind me. Everybody behaves according to his nature. It cannot be
helped, nor need it be regretted.
<!--l. 11058--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Others suffer.
<!--l. 11060--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Life lives on life. In nature the process is compulsory, in society it
should be voluntary. There can be no life without sacrifice. A sinner
refuses to sacrifice and invites death. This is as it is, and gives no cause
for condemnation or pity.
<!--l. 11062--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Surely you feel at least compassion when you see a man steeped in
sin.
<!--l. 11064--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11066--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Right, and what next?
<!--l. 11068--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By my becoming one with him he becomes one with me. It is not a

conscious process, it happens entirely by itself. None of us can help it.
What needs changing shall change anyhow; enough to know oneself as
one is, here and now. Intense and methodical investigation into one&#8217;s
mind is Yoga.
<!--l. 11070--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11072--><p class="noindent" ><span

compulsion to sin again, ceases.

<!--l. 11076--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11084--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I know no bad people, I only know myself. I see no saints nor
sinners, only living beings. I do not hand out grace. There is nothing I
can give, or deny, which you do not have already in equal measure. Just
be aware of your riches and make full use of them. As long as you
imagine that you need my grace, you will be at my door begging for
it.

happens as you say.
<!--l. 11102--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You may as well say that it is the mother&#8217;s heart that saved the
child. For everything there are innumerable causes.
<!--l. 11104--><p class="noindent" ><span

all-powerful. The entire universe is at his disposal.
<!--l. 11106--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you believe so, act on it. Abandon every personal desire and use
the power thus saved for changing the world!
<!--l. 11108--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All the Buddhas and Rishis have not succeeded in changing the
world.
<!--l. 11110--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world does not yield to changing. By its very nature it is
painful and transient. See it as it is and divest yourself of all desire and
fear. When the world does not hold and bind you, it becomes an abode
of joy and beauty. You can be happy in the world only when you are
free of it.

<!--l. 11112--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is right and what is wrong?
<!--l. 11114--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Generally, what causes suffering is wrong and what removes it, is
right. The body and the mind are limited and therefore vulnerable;
they need protection which gives rise to fear. As long as you
identify yourself with them you are bound to suffer; realise your
independence and remain happy. I tell you, this is the secret of
happiness. To believe that you depend on things and people
for happiness is due to ignorance of your true nature; to know
that you need nothing to be happy, except self-knowledge, is
wisdom.
<!--l. 11116--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What comes first, being or desire?
<!--l. 11118--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>With being arising in consciousness, the ideas of what you are arise
in your mind as well as what you should be. This brings forth desire
and action and the process of becoming begins.
<!--l. 11120--><p class="noindent" >Becoming has, apparently, no beginning and no end, for it restarts
every moment. With the cessation of imagination and desire, becoming
ceases and the being this or that merges into pure being, which is not
describable, only experienceable.
<!--l. 11122--><p class="noindent" >The world appears to you so overwhelmingly real, because you think of
it all the time; cease thinking of it and it will dissolve into thin mist.
You need not forget; when desire and fear end, bondage also
ends. It is the emotional involvement, the pattern of likes and
dislikes which we call character and temperament, that create the
bondage.
<!--l. 11124--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Without desire and fear what motive is there for action?
<!--l. 11126--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>None, unless you consider love of life, of righteousness, of beauty,
motive enough. Do not be afraid of freedom from desire and fear. It

enables you to live a life so different from all you know, so much
more intense and interesting, that, truly, by losing all you gain
all.
<!--l. 11128--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Since you count your spiritual ancestry from Rishi Dattatreya,
are we right in believing that you and all your predecessors are
reincarnations of the Rishi?
<!--l. 11130--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You may believe in whatever you like and if you act on your belief,
you will get the fruits of it; but to me it has no importance. I am what
I am and this is enough for me. I have no desire to identify myself with
anybody, however illustrious. Nor do I feel the need to take myths
for reality. I am only interested in ignorance and the freedom
from ignorance. The proper role of a Guru is to dispel ignorance
in the hearts and minds of his disciples. Once the disciple has
understood, the confirming action is up to him. Nobody can
act for another. And if he does not act rightly, it only means
that he has not understood and that the Guru&#8217;s work is not
over.
<!--l. 11132--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There must be some hopeless cases too?
<!--l. 11134--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>None is hopeless. Obstacles can be overcome. What life cannot
mend, death will end, but the Guru cannot fail.
<!--l. 11136--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What gives you the assurance?
<!--l. 11138--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The Guru and man&#8217;s inner reality are really one and work together
towards the same goal &#8211; the redemption and salvation of the mind
They cannot fail. Out of the very boulders that obstruct them they
build their bridges. Consciousness is not the whole of being &#8211; there
are other levels on which man is much more co-operative. The
Guru is at home on all levels and his energy and patience are
inexhaustible.

<!--l. 11140--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You keep on telling me that I am dreaming and that it is high time
I should wake up. How does it happen that the Maharaj, who has come
to me in my dreams, has not succeeded in waking me up? He keeps on
urging and reminding, but the dream continues.
<!--l. 11142--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is because you have not really understood that you are dreaming.
This is the essence of bondage &#8211; the mixing of the real with unreal. In
your present state only the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; refers to reality; the
&#8216;what&#8217; and the &#8216;how I am&#8217; are illusions imposed by destiny, or
accident.
<!--l. 11144--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When did the dream begin?
<!--l. 11146--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It appears to be beginningless, but in fact it is only now. From
moment to moment you are renewing it. Once you have seen
that you are dreaming, you shall wake up. But you do not see,
because you want the dream to continue. A day will come when
you will long for the ending of the dream, with all your heart
and mind, and be willing to pay any price; the price will be
dispassion and detachment, the loss of interest in the dream
itself.
<!--l. 11148--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How helpless I am. As long as the dream of existence lasts,
I want it to continue. As long as I want it to continue, it will
last.
<!--l. 11150--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Wanting it to continue is not inevitable. See clearly your condition,
your very clarity will release you.
<!--l. 11152--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As long as I am with you, all you say seems pretty obvious;
but as soon as I am away from you I run about restless and
anxious.
<!--l. 11154--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You need not keep away from me, in your mind at least. But your

mind is after the world&#8217;s welfare!
<!--l. 11156--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The world is full of troubles, no wonder my mind too is full of
them.
<!--l. 11158--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Was there ever a world without troubles? Your being as a person
depends on violence to others. Your very body is a battlefield, full of
the dead and dying. Existence implies violence.
<!--l. 11160--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As a body &#8211; yes. As a human being &#8211; definitely no. For humanity
non-violence is the law of life and violence of death.
<!--l. 11162--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is little of non-violence in nature.
<!--l. 11164--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>God and nature are not human and need not be humane. I am
concerned with man alone. To be human I must be compassionate
absolutely.
<!--l. 11166--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Do you realise that as long as you have a self to defend, you must
be violent?
<!--l. 11168--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I do. To be truly human I must be self-less. As long as I am selfish,
I am sub-human, a humanoid only.
<!--l. 11170--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>So, we are all sub-human and only a few are human. Few or many,
it is again &#8216;clarity and charity&#8217; that make us human. The sub-human &#8211;
the &#8216;humanoids&#8217; &#8211; are dominated by tamas and rajas and the humans
by sattva. Clarity and charity is sattva as it affects mind and
action. But the real is beyond sattva. Since I have known you, you
seem to be always after helping the world. How much did you
help?
<!--l. 11172--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Not a bit. Neither the world has changed, nor have I. But the world
suffers and I suffer along with it. To struggle against suffering is a

natural reaction. And what is civilization and culture, philosophy and
religion, but a revolt against suffering. Evil and the ending of evil &#8211; is it
not your own main preoccupation? You may call it ignorance &#8211; it comes
to the same.
<!--l. 11174--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Well, words do not matter, nor does it matter in what shape you
are just now. Names and shapes change incessantly. Know yourself to
be the changeless witness of the changeful mind.
<!--l. 11176--><p class="noindent" >That is enough.

class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Can you sit on the floor? Do you need a pillow? Have you
any questions to ask? Not that you need to ask, you can as well be
quiet. To be, just be, is important. You need not ask anything, nor do
anything. Such apparently lazy way of spending time is highly regarded
in India. It means that for the time being you are free from the
obsession with &#8216;what next&#8217;. When you Are not in a hurry and the mind
is free from anxieties, it becomes quiet and in the silence something
may be heard which is ordinarily too fine and subtle for perception.
The mind must be open and quiet to see. What we are trying to do
here is to bring our minds into the right state for understanding what is
real.
<!--l. 11182--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11200--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>For some time the mental habits may linger in spite of the new
vision, the habit of longing for the known past and fearing the
unknown future. When you know these are of the mind only, you can
go beyond them. As long as you have all sorts of ideas about
yourself, you know yourself through the mist of these ideas; to know
yourself as you are, give up all ideas. You cannot imagine the
taste of pure water, you can only discover it by abandoning all
flavourings.
<!--l. 11202--><p class="noindent" >As long as you are interested in your present way of living, you

these dimensions of existence, of which India was always the

<!--l. 11212--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Learning words is not enough. You may know the theory, but
without the actual experience of yourself as the impersonal and
unqualified centre of being, love and bliss, mere verbal knowledge is

sterile.
<!--l. 11214--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then, what am I to do?
<!--l. 11216--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Try to be, only to be. The all-important word is &#8216;try&#8217;. Allot enough
time daily for sitting quietly and trying, just trying, to go beyond the
personality, with its addictions and obsessions. Don&#8217;t ask how, it
cannot be explained. You just keep on trying until you succeed. If you
persevere, there can be no failure. What matters supremely is
sincerity, earnestness; you must really have had surfeit of being the
person you are, now see the urgent need of being free of this
unnecessary self-identification with a bundle of memories and habits.
This steady resistance against the unnecessary is the secret of
success.
<!--l. 11218--><p class="noindent" >After all, you are what you are every moment of your life, but
you are never conscious of it, except, maybe, at the point of
awakening from sleep. All you need is to be aware of being, not as a
verbal statement, but as an ever-present fact. The a awareness
that you are will open your eyes to what you are. It is all very
simple. First of all, establish a constant contact with your self, be
with yourself all the time. Into self-awareness all blessings flow.
Begin as a centre of observation, deliberate cognisance, and grow
into a centre of love in action. &#8216;I am&#8217; is a tiny seed which will
grow into a mighty tree &#8211; quite naturally, without a trace of
effort.
<!--l. 11220--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11222--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Evil is the shadow of inattention. In the light of self-awareness it
will wither and fall off.
<!--l. 11224--><p class="noindent" >All dependence on another is futile, for what others can give others will
take away. Only what is your own at the start will remain your own in

the end. Accept no guidance but from within, and even then sift out
all memories for they will mislead you. Even if you are quite
ignorant of the ways and the means, keep quiet and look within;
guidance is sure to come. You are never left without knowing
what your next step should be. The trouble is that you may
shirk it. The Guru is there for giving you courage because of his
experience and success. But only what you discover through your
own awareness, your own effort, will be of permanent use to
you.
<!--l. 11226--><p class="noindent" >Remember, nothing you perceive is your own. Nothing of value
can come to you from outside; it is only your own feeling and
understanding that are relevant and revealing. Words, heard or read,
will only create images in your mind, but you are not a mental image.
You are the power of perception and action behind and beyond the
image.
<!--l. 11228--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You seem to advise me to be self-centred to the point of egoism.
Must I not yield even to my interest in other people?
<!--l. 11230--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Your interest in others is egoistic, self-concerned, self-oriented. You
are not interested in others as persons, but only as far as they enrich,
or ennoble your own image of yourself. And the ultimate in selfishness
is to care only for the protection, preservation and multiplication of
one&#8217;s own body.
<!--l. 11232--><p class="noindent" >By body I mean all that is related to your name and shape &#8211; your
family, tribe, country, race, etc. To be attached to one&#8217;s name and

mind cannot be selfish, for he has nothing to be selfish for. Or, you may
say, he is equally &#8216;selfish&#8217;

<!--l. 11252--><p class="noindent" ><span

strangers. When the centre of selfishness is no longer, all desires for
pleasure and fear of pain cease; one is no longer interested in being
happy; beyond happiness there is pure intensity, inexhaustible energy,
the ecstasy of giving from a perennial source.

class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Mustn&#8217;t I begin by solving for myself the problem of right and
wrong?
<!--l. 11256--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is pleasant people take it to be good and what is painful they
take it to be bad.

<!--l. 11258--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, that is how it is with us, ordinary people. But how is it with
you, at the level of oneness?
<!--l. 11260--><p class="noindent" >For you what is good and what is bad?
<!--l. 11262--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What increases suffering is bad and what removes it is good.
<!--l. 11264--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>So you deny goodness to suffering itself. There are religions in which
suffering is considered good and noble.
<!--l. 11266--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Karma, or destiny, is an expression of a beneficial law: the universal
trend towards balance, harmony and unity. At every moment, whatever
happens now, is for the best. It may appear painful and ugly, a
suffering bitter and meaningless, yet considering the past and
the future it is for the best, as the only way out of a disastrous
situation.
<!--l. 11268--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Does one suffer only for one&#8217;s own sins?
<!--l. 11270--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>One suffers along with what one thinks oneself to be. If you feel one
with humanity, you suffer with humanity.
<!--l. 11272--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>And since you claim to be one with the sufferers, there is no limit in
time or space to your suffering!
<!--l. 11274--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To be is to suffer. The narrower the circle of my self-identification,
the more acute the suffering caused by desire and fear.
<!--l. 11276--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Christianity accepts suffering as purifying and ennobling, while
Hinduism looks at it with distaste.
<!--l. 11278--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Christianity is one way of putting words together and Hinduism is
another. The real is, behind and beyond words, incommunicable,
directly experienced, explosive in its effect on the mind. It is easily had

when nothing else is wanted. The innards created by imagination and
perpetuated by desire.
<!--l. 11280--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Can there be no suffering that is necessary and good?
<!--l. 11282--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Accidental or incidental pain is inevitable and transitory; deliberate
pain, inflicted with even the best of intentions, is meaningless and
cruel.
<!--l. 11284--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You would not punish crime?
<!--l. 11286--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Punishment is but legalised crime. In a society built on prevention,
rather than retaliation, there would be very little crime. The few
exceptions will be treated medically, as of unsound mind and
body.
<!--l. 11288--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You seem to have little use for religion.
<!--l. 11290--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What is religion? A cloud in the sky. I live in the sky, not in the
clouds, which are so many words held together. Remove the verbiage
and what remains? Truth remains. My home is in the unchangeable,
which appears to be a state of constant reconciliation and integration
of opposites.
<!--l. 11292--><p class="noindent" >People come here to learn about the actual existence of such a state,
the obstacles to its emergence, and, once perceived, the art of
stabilising it in consciousness, so that there is no clash between
understanding and living. The state itself is beyond the mind and need
not be learnt. The mind can only focus the obstacles; seeing
an obstacle as an obstacle is effective, because it is the mind
acting on the mind. Begin from the beginning: give attention to
the fact that you are. At no time can you say &#8216;I was not&#8217; all
you can say: &#8216;I do not remember&#8217;. You know how unreliable is
memory.

<!--l. 11294--><p class="noindent" >Accept that, engrossed in petty personal affairs you have forgotten
what you are; try to bring back the lost memory through the
elimination of the known. You cannot be told what will happen, nor is
it desirable; anticipation will create illusions. In the inner search the
unexpected is inevitable; the discovery is invariably beyond all
imagination. Just as an unborn child cannot know life after birth, for it
has nothing in its mind with which to form a valid picture, so is the
mind unable to think of the real in terms of the unreal, except by
negation: &#8216;Not this, not that&#8217;. The acceptance of the unreal as real
is the obstacle; to see the false as false and abandon the false
brings reality into being. The states of utter clarity, immense love,
utter fearlessness; these are mere words at the present, outlines
without colour, hints at what can be. You are like a blind man
expecting to see as a result of an operation &#8211; provided you do not
shirk the operation! The state I am in words do not matter at
all.
<!--l. 11296--><p class="noindent" >Nor is there any addiction to words. Only facts matter.
<!--l. 11298--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There can be no religion without words.
<!--l. 11300--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Recorded religions are mere heaps of verbiage. Religions show their
true face in action, in silent action. To know what man believes, watch
how he acts. For most of the people service of their bodies and their
minds is their religion. They may have religious ideas, but they do not
act on them.
<!--l. 11302--><p class="noindent" >They play with them, they are often very fond of them, but they will
not act on them.
<!--l. 11304--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Words are needed for communication.
<!--l. 11306--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>For exchange of information &#8211; yes. But real communication
between people is not verbal. For establishing and maintaining

relationship affectionate awareness expressed in direct action is
required. Not what you say, but what you do is that matters. Words
are made by the mind and are meaningful only on the level of the
mind. The word &#8216;bread&#8217;: neither can you eat nor live by it; it merely
conveys an idea. It acquires meaning only with the actual eating. In the
same sense am I telling you that the Normal State is not verbal.
I may say it is wise love expressed in action, but these words
convey little, unless you experience them in their fullness and
beauty.
<!--l. 11308--><p class="noindent" >Words have their limited usefulness, but we put no limits to them and
bring ourselves to the brink of disaster. Our noble ideas are finely
balanced by ignoble actions. We talk of God, Truth and Love, but
instead of direct experience we have definitions. Instead of enlarging
and deepening action we chisel our definitions. And we imagine that we
know what we can define!
<!--l. 11310--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can one convey experience except through words?
<!--l. 11312--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Experience cannot be conveyed through words. It comes with
action. A man who is intense in his experience will radiate confidence
and courage. Others too will act and gain experience born out of
action. Verbal teaching has its use, it prepares the mind for voiding
itself of its accumulations.
<!--l. 11314--><p class="noindent" >A level of mental maturity is reached when nothing external is of any
value and the heart is ready to relinquish all. Then the real has a
chance and it grasps it. Delays, if any, are caused by the mind being
unwilling to see or to discard.
<!--l. 11316--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are we so totally alone?
<!--l. 11318--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Oh, no, we are not. Those who have, can give. And such givers are
many. The world itself is a supreme gift, maintained by loving sacrifice.

But the right receivers, wise and humble, are so few. &#8216;Ask and you shall
be given&#8217; is the eternal law.
<!--l. 11321--><p class="noindent" >So many words you have learnt, so many you have spoken. You know
everything, but you do not know yourself. For the self is not known
through words &#8211; only direct insight will reveal it. Look within, search
within.
<!--l. 11323--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is very difficult to abandon words. Our mental life is one
continuous stream of words.
<!--l. 11325--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is not a matter of easy, or difficult. You have no alternative.
Either you try or you don&#8217;t. It is up to you.
<!--l. 11327--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have tried many times and failed.
<!--l. 11329--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Try again. If you keep on trying, something may happen. But if you
don&#8217;t, you are stuck. You may know all the right words, quote the
scriptures, be brilliant in your discussions and yet remain a bag of
bones. Or you may be inconspicuous and humble, an insignificant
person altogether, yet glowing with loving kindness and deep
wisdom.

 id="x1-10400099"></a>The Perceived can not be the Perceiver</h2>
<!--l. 11333--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>I have been moving from place to place investigating the
various Yogas available for practice and I could not decide which will
suit me best. I should be thankful for some competent advice. At
present, as a result of all this searching, I am just tired of the idea of
finding truth. It seems to me, both unnecessary and troublesome.
Life is enjoyable as it is and I see no purpose in improving on
it.
<!--l. 11335--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You are welcome to stay in your contentment, but can
you? Youth, vigour, money &#8211; all will pass away sooner than you
expect. Sorrow, shunned so far, will pursue you. If you want to be
beyond suffering, you must meet it half way and embrace it.
Relinquish your habits and addictions, live a simple and sober
life, don&#8217;t hurt a living being; this is the foundation of Yoga.
To find reality you must be real in the smallest daily action;
there can be no deceit in the search for truth. You say you find
your life enjoyable. Maybe it is &#8211; at present. But who enjoys
it?
<!--l. 11337--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I confess I do not know the enjoyer nor the enjoyed. I only know the
enjoyment.
<!--l. 11339--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite right. But enjoyment is a state of mind &#8211; it comes and goes.
Its very impermanence makes it perceivable. You cannot be conscious
of what does not change. All consciousness is consciousness of change.
But the very perception of change &#8211; does it not necessitate a changeless
background?
<!--l. 11341--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Not at all. The memory of the last state &#8211; compared to the
actuality of the present state gives the experience of change.
<!--l. 11343--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Between the remembered and the actual there is a basic difference

which can be observed from moment to moment. At no point
of time is the actual the remembered. Between the two there
is a difference in kind, not merely in intensity. The actual is
unmistakably so. By no effort of will or imagination can you
interchange the two. Now, what is it that gives this unique quality to
the actual?
<!--l. 11345--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The actual is real, while there is a good deal of uncertainty about
the remembered.
<!--l. 11347--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite so, but why? A moment back the remembered was actual, in
a moment the actual will be the remembered. What makes the actual
unique? Obviously, it is your sense of being present. In memory and
anticipation there is a clear feeling that it is a mental state under
observation, while in the actual the feeling is primarily of being present
and aware.
<!--l. 11349--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes I can see. It is awareness that makes the difference between the
actual and the remembered. One thinks of the past or the future, but
one is present in the now.
<!--l. 11351--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Wherever you go, the sense of here and now you carry with you all
the time. It means that you are independent of space and time, that
space and time are in you, not you in them. It is your self-identification
with the body, which, of course, is limited in space and time, that
gives you the feeling of finiteness. In reality you are infinite and
eternal.
<!--l. 11353--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This infinite and eternal self of mine, how am I to know it?
<!--l. 11355--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The self you want to know, is it some second self? Are you made of
several selves? Surely, there is only one self and you are that self. The
self you are is the only self there is. Remove and abandon your wrong
ideas about yourself and there it is, in all its glory. It is only your mind

that prevents self-knowledge.
<!--l. 11357--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How am I to be rid of the mind? And is life without mind at all
possible on the human level?
<!--l. 11359--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>There is no such thing as mind. There are ideas and some of them
are wrong. Abandon the wrong ideas, for they are false and obstruct
your vision of yourself.
<!--l. 11361--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Which ideas are wrong and which are true?
<!--l. 11363--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Assertions are usually wrong and denials &#8211; right.
<!--l. 11365--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>One cannot live by denying everything!
<!--l. 11367--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Only by denying can one live. Assertion is bondage. To question
and deny is necessary. It is the essence of revolt and without revolt
there can be no freedom.
<!--l. 11369--><p class="noindent" >There is no second, or higher self to search for. You are the highest
self, only give up the false ideas you have about your self. Both
faith and reason tell you that you are neither the body, nor its
desires and fears, nor are you the mind with its fanciful ideas,
nor the role society compels you to play, the person you are
supposed to be. Give up the false and the true will come into its
own.
<!--l. 11371--><p class="noindent" >You say you want to know your self. You are your self &#8211; you cannot be
anything but what you are.
<!--l. 11373--><p class="noindent" >Is knowing separate from being? Whatever you can know with your
mind is of the mind, not you; about yourself you can only say: &#8216;I am, I
am aware, I like It&#8217;.

<!--l. 11375--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find being alive a painful state.
<!--l. 11377--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You cannot be alive for you are life itself. It is the person you
imagine yourself to be that suffers, not you. Dissolve it in awareness. It
is merely a bundle of memories and habits. From the awareness of the
unreal to the awareness of your real nature there is a chasm which
you will easily cross, once you have mastered the art of pure
awareness.
<!--l. 11379--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>All I know is that I do not know myself.
<!--l. 11381--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How do you know, that you do not know your self? Your direct
insight tells you that yourself you know first, for nothing exists to you
without your being there to experience its existence. You imagine you
do not know your self, because you cannot describe your self. You can
always say: &#8216;I know that I am&#8217; and you will refuse as untrue the
statement: &#8216;I am not&#8217;. But whatever can be described cannot be your
self, and what you are cannot be described. You can only know your
self by being yourself without any attempt at self-definition and
self-description. Once you have understood that you are nothing
perceivable or conceivable, that whatever appears in the field of
consciousness cannot be your self, you will apply yourself to the
eradication of all self-identification, as the only way that can take
you to a deeper realisation of your self. You literally progress
by rejection &#8211; a veritable rocket. To know that you are neither
in the body nor in the mind, though aware of both, is already
self-knowledge.
<!--l. 11383--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I am neither the body nor mind, how am I aware of them? How
can I perceive something quite foreign to myself?
<!--l. 11385--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>&#8216;Nothing is me,&#8217; is the first step. &#8216;Everything is me&#8217; is the next.
Both hang on the idea: &#8216;there is a world&#8217;. When this too is given up,
you remain what you are &#8211; the non-dual Self. You are it here and now,

but your vision is obstructed by your false ideas about your
self.
<!--l. 11387--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Well, I admit that I am, I was, I shall be; at least from birth to
death. I have no doubts of my being, here and now. But I find that it is
not enough. My life lacks joy, born of harmony between the inner and
the outer. If I alone am and the world is merely a protection, then why
is there disharmony?
<!--l. 11389--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You create disharmony and then complain! When you desire
and fear, and identify yourself with your feelings, you create
sorrow and bondage. When you create, with love and wisdom, and
remain unattached to your creations, the result is harmony and
peace. But whatever be the condition of your mind, in what way
does it reflect on you? It is only your self-identification with
your mind that makes you happy or unhappy. Rebel against
your slavery to your mind, see your bonds as self-created and
break the chains of attachment and revulsion. Keep in mind
your goal of freedom, until it dawns on you that you are already
free, that freedom is not something in the distant future to be
earned with painful efforts, but perennially one&#8217;s own, to be
used! Liberation is not an acquisition but a matter of courage,
the courage to believe that you are free already and to act on
it.
<!--l. 11391--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I do as I like, I shall have to suffer.
<!--l. 11393--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Nevertheless, you are free. The consequences of your action will
depend on the society in which you live and its conventions.
<!--l. 11395--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I may act recklessly.
<!--l. 11397--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Along with courage will emerge wisdom and compassion and skill
in action. You will know what to do and whatever you do will be good

for all.
<!--l. 11399--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I find that the various aspects of myself are at war between
themselves and there is no peace in me. Where are freedom and
courage, wisdom and compassion? My actions merely increase the
chasm in which I exist.
<!--l. 11401--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is all so, because you take yourself to be somebody, or
something. Stop, look, investigate, ask the right questions, come to
the right conclusions and have the courage to act on them and
see what happens. The first steps may bring the roof down on
your head, but soon the commotion will clear and there will be
peace and joy. You know so many things about yourself, but the
knower you do not know. Find out who you are, the knower of the
known. Look within diligently, remember to remember that the
perceived cannot be the perceiver. Whatever you see, hear or
think of, remember &#8211; you are not what happens, you are he to
whom it happens. Delve deeply into the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; and you will
surely discover that the perceiving centre is universal, as universal
as the light that illumines the world. All that happens in the
universe happens to you, the silent witness. On the other hand,
whatever is done, is done by you, the universal and inexhaustible
energy.
<!--l. 11403--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It is, no doubt, very gratifying to hear that one is the silent witness
as well as the universal energy. But how is one to cross over
from a verbal statement to direct knowledge? Hearing is not
knowing.
<!--l. 11405--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Before you can know anything directly, non-verbally, you must
know the knower. So far, you took the mind for the knower,
but it is just not so. The mind clogs you up with images and
ideas, which leave scars in memory. You take remembering to be
knowledge. True knowledge is ever fresh, new, unexpected. It

wells up from within. When you know what you are, you also
are what you know. Between knowing and being there is no
gap.
<!--l. 11407--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I can only investigate the mind with the mind.
<!--l. 11409--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By all means use your mind to know your mind. It is perfectly
legitimate and also the best preparation for going beyond the mind.
Being, knowing and enjoying is your own. First realise your own
being. This is easy because the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; is always with you.
Then meet yourself as the knower, apart from the known. Once
you know yourself as pure being, the ecstasy of freedom is your
own.
<!--l. 11411--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Which Yoga is this?
<!--l. 11413--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Why worry? What makes you come here is your being displeased
with your life as you know it, the life of your body and mind. You may
try to improve them, through controlling and bending them to an ideal,
or you may cut the knot of self-identification altogether and look at
your body and mind as something that happens without committing
you in any way.
<!--l. 11415--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Shall I call the way of control and discipline raja yoga and the way
of detachment &#8211; jnana yoga? And the worship of an ideal &#8211; bhakti
yoga?
<!--l. 11417--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If it pleases you. Words indicate, but do not explain. What I teach
is the ancient and simple way of liberation through understanding.
Understand your own mind and its hold on you will snap. The
mind misunderstands, misunderstanding is its very nature. Right
understanding is the only remedy, whatever name you give it. It is
the earliest and also the latest, for it deals with the mind as it
is.

<!--l. 11419--><p class="noindent" >Nothing you do will change you, for you need no change. You may
change your mind or your body, but it is always something external to
you that has changed, not yourself. Why bother at all to change?
realise once for all that neither your body nor your mind, nor even your
consciousness is yourself and stand alone in your true nature beyond
consciousness and unconsciousness. No effort can take you there, only
the clarity of understanding. Trace your misunderstandings and
abandon them, that is all. There is nothing to seek and find, for there is
nothing lost. Relax and watch the &#8216;I am&#8217;. Reality is just behind it.
Keep quiet, keep silent; it will emerge, or, rather, it will take you
in.
<!--l. 11421--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Must I not get rid of my body and mind first?
<!--l. 11423--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You cannot, for the very idea binds you to them. Just understand
and disregard.
<!--l. 11425--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am unable to disregard, for I am not integrated.
<!--l. 11427--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Imagine you are completely integrated, your thought and action
fully co-ordinated. How will it help you? It will not free you from
mistaking yourself to be the body or the mind. See them correctly as
&#8216;not you&#8217;, that is all.
<!--l. 11429--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You want me to remember to forget!
<!--l. 11431--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, it looks so. Yet, it is not hopeless. You can do it. Just set
about it in earnest. Your blind groping is full of promise. Your very
searching is the finding. You cannot fail.
<!--l. 11433--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Because we are disintegrated, we suffer.
<!--l. 11435--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>We shall suffer as long as our thoughts and actions are prompted
by desires and fears. See their futility and the danger and chaos they

create will subside. Don&#8217;t try to reform yourself, just see the futility of
all change. The changeful keeps on changing while the changeless is
waiting. Do not expect the changeful, to take you to the changeless &#8211;
it can never happen. Only when the very idea of changing is
seen as false and abandoned, the changeless can come into its
own.
<!--l. 11437--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Everywhere I go, l am told that I must change profoundly before I
can see the real. This process of deliberate, self-imposed change is
called Yoga.
<!--l. 11439--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>All change affects the mind only. To be what you are, you must go
beyond the mind, into your own being. It is immaterial what is the
mind that you leave behind, provided you leave it behind for good.
This again is not possible without self-realisation.
<!--l. 11441--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What comes first &#8211; the abandoning of the mind or self-realisation?
<!--l. 11443--><p class="noindent" >M:. Self-realisation definitely comes first. The mind cannot go beyond
itself by itself. It must explode.
<!--l. 11445--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>No exploration before explosion?
<!--l. 11447--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The explosive power comes from the real. But you are well advised
to have your mind ready for it. Fear can always delay it, until another
opportunity arises.
<!--l. 11449--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I thought there is always a chance.
<!--l. 11451--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>In theory &#8211; yes. In practice a situation must arise, when all the
factors necessary for self-realisation are present. This need not I
discourage you. Your dwelling on the fact of &#8216;I am&#8217; will soon create
another chance. For, attitude attracts opportunity. All you know is
second-hand. Only &#8216;I am&#8217; is first-hand and needs no proofs. Stay with

it.

<!--l. 11455--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>In many countries of the world investigating officers
follow certain practices aimed at extracting confessions from their
victim and also changing his personality, if needed. By a judicious
choice of physical and moral deprivations and by persuasions the old
personality is broken down and a new personality established in its
place. The man under investigation hears so many times repeated that
he is an enemy of the State and a traitor to his country, that a day
comes when something breaks down in him and he begins to feel with
full conviction that he is a traitor, a rebel, altogether despicable
and deserving the direst punishment. This process is known as
brain-washing.
<!--l. 11457--><p class="noindent" >It struck me that the religious and Yogic practices are very similar to
&#8216;brain-washing&#8217;. The same physical and mental deprivation, solitary
confinement, a powerful sense of sin, despair and a desire to escape
through expiation and conversion, adoption of a new image of oneself
and impersonating that image. The same repetition of set formulas:
&#8216;God is good; the Guru (party) knows; faith will save me.&#8217; In the
so-called Yogic or religious practices the same mechanism operates.
The mind is made to concentrate on some particular idea to
the exclusion of all other ideas and concentration is powerfully
reinforced by rigid discipline and painful austerities. A high price in
life and happiness is paid and what one gets in return appears
therefore, to be of great importance. This prearranged conversion,
obvious or hidden, religious or political, ethical or social, may look
genuine and lasting, yet there is a feeling of artificiality about
it.
<!--l. 11459--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>You are quite right. By undergoing so many hardships the
mind gets dislocated and immobilised. Its condition becomes
precarious; whatever it undertakes, ends in a deeper bondage.

<!--l. 11461--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Then why are sadhanas prescribed?
<!--l. 11463--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Unless you make tremendous efforts, you will not be convinced that
effort will take you nowhere. The self is so self confident, that unless it
is totally discouraged, it will not give up. Mere verbal conviction is not
enough. Hard facts alone can show the absolute nothingness of the
self-image.
<!--l. 11465--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The brain-washer drives me mad, and the Guru drives me sane. The
driving is similar. Yet the motive and the purpose are totally different.
The similarities are, perhaps merely verbal.
<!--l. 11467--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Inviting, or compelling to suffer contains in it violence and the fruit
of violence cannot be sweet.
<!--l. 11469--><p class="noindent" >There are certain life situations, inevitably painful, and you have to
take them in your stride. There are also certain situations which
you have created, either deliberately or by neglect. And from
these you have to learn a lesson so that they are not repeated
again.
<!--l. 11471--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It seems that we must suffer, so that we learn to overcome
pain.
<!--l. 11473--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Pain has to be endured. There is no such thing as overcoming the
pain and no training is needed. Training for the future, developing
attitudes is a sign of fear.
<!--l. 11475--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Once I know how to face pain, I am free of it, not afraid of it, and
therefore happy. This is what happens to a prisoner. He accepts his
punishment as just and proper and is at peace with the prison
authorities and the State. All religions do nothing else but preach
acceptance and surrender.

<!--l. 11477--><p class="noindent" >We are being encouraged to plead guilty, to feel responsible for all the
evils in the world and point at ourselves as their only cause. My
problem is: I cannot see much difference between brain-washing and
sadhana, except that in the case of sadhana one is not physically
constrained. The element of compulsive suggestion is present in
both.
<!--l. 11479--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As you have said, the similarities are superficial. You need not harp
on them.
<!--l. 11481--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Sir, the similarities are not superficial. Man is a complex being
and can be at the same time the accuser and the accused, the
judge, the warden and the executioner. There is not much that is
voluntary in a &#8216;voluntary&#8217; sadhana. One is moved by forces beyond
one&#8217;s ken and control. I can change my mental metabolism as
little as the physical, except by painful and protracted efforts
&#8211;
<!--l. 11483--><p class="noindent" >which is Yoga. All I am asking is: does Maharaj agree with me that
Yoga implies violence?
<!--l. 11485--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I agree that Yoga, as presented by you, means violence and I never
advocate any form of violence. My path is totally non-violent. I mean
exactly what I say: non-violent. Find out for yourself what it is. I
merely say: it is non-violent.
<!--l. 11487--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am not misusing words. When a Guru asks me to meditate sixteen
hours a day for the rest of my life, I cannot do it without extreme
violence to myself. Is such a Guru right or wrong?
<!--l. 11489--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>None compels you to meditate sixteen hours a day, unless you feel
like doing so. It is only a way of telling you: &#8216;remain with yourself,
don&#8217;t get lost among others&#8217;. The teacher will wait, but the mind is
impatient.

<!--l. 11491--><p class="noindent" >It is not the teacher, it is the mind that is violent and also afraid of its
own violence. What is of the mind is relative, it is a mistake to make it
into an absolute.
<!--l. 11493--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I remain passive, nothing will change. If I am active, I
must be violent. What is it I can do which is neither sterile nor
violent?
<!--l. 11495--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Of course, there is a way which is neither violent nor sterile
and yet supremely effective. Just look at yourself as you are,
see yourself as you are, accept yourself as you are and go ever
deeper into what you are. Violence and non-violence describe your
attitude to others; the self in relation to itself is neither violent nor
non-violent, it is either aware or unaware of itself. If it knows
itself, all it does will be right; if it does not, all it does will be
wrong.
<!--l. 11497--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What do you mean by saying: I know myself as I am?
<!--l. 11499--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Before the mind &#8211; I am. &#8216;I am&#8217; is not a thought in the mind; the
mind happens to me, I do not happen to the mind. And since time and
space are in the mind, I am beyond time and space, eternal and
omnipresent.
<!--l. 11501--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you serious? Do you really mean that you exist everywhere and
at all times?
<!--l. 11503--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yes, I do. To me it is as obvious, as the freedom of movement is to
you. Imagine a tree asking a monkey: &#8216;Do you seriously mean that you
can move from place to place?&#8217; And the monkey saying: &#8216;Yes. I
do.&#8217;
<!--l. 11506--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you also free from causality? Can you produce miracles?

<!--l. 11508--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>The world itself is a miracle. I am beyond miracles &#8211; I am
absolutely normal. With me everything happens as it must. I do
not interfere with creation. Of what use are small miracles to
me when the greatest of miracles is happening all the time?
Whatever you see it is always your own being that you see. Go ever
deeper into yourself, seek within, there is neither violence nor
non-violence in self-discovery. The destruction of the false is not
violence.
<!--l. 11510--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>When I practice self-enquiry, or go within with the idea that it will
profit me in some way or other, I am still escaping from what I
am.
<!--l. 11512--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Quite right. True enquiry is always into something, not out of
something. When I enquire how to get, or avoid something, I
am not really inquiring. To know anything I must accept it &#8211;
totally.
<!--l. 11514--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Yes, to know God I must accept God &#8211; how frightening!
<!--l. 11516--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Before you can accept God, you must accept yourself, which is even
more frightening. The first steps in self acceptance are not at all
pleasant, for what one sees is not a happy sight. One needs all the
courage to go further. What helps is silence. Look at yourself in total
silence, do not describe yourself. Look at the being you believe you are
and remember &#8211; you are not what you see. &#8216;This I am not &#8211;
what am l?&#8217; is the movement of self-enquiry. There are no other
means to liberation, all means delay. Resolutely reject what you
are not, till the real Self emerges in its glorious nothingness, its
&#8216;not-a-thingness.&#8217;
<!--l. 11518--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>The world is passing through rapid and critical changes. We can see
them with great clarity in the United States, though they happen in
other countries. There is an increase in crime on one hand and more

genuine holiness on the other. Communities are being formed and some
of them are on a very high level of integrity and austerity. It
looks as if evil is destroying itself by its own successes, like a fire
which consumes its fuel, while the good, like life, perpetuates
itself.
<!--l. 11520--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>As long as you divide events into good and evil, you may be right.
In fact, good becomes evil and evil becomes good by their own
fulfilment.
<!--l. 11522--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11524--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11528--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Remembering &#8211; imagining &#8211; anticipating. It is sensory and verbal.
A form of addiction.
<!--l. 11530--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Is brahmacharya, continence, imperative in Yoga?
<!--l. 11532--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A life of constraint and suppression is not Yoga. Mind must be free
of desires and relaxed. It comes with understanding, not with
determination, which is but another form of memory. An understanding
mind is free of desires and fears.
<!--l. 11534--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How can I make myself understand?
<!--l. 11536--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>By meditating which means giving attention. Become fully
aware of your problem, look at it from all sides, watch how it
affects your life. Then leave it alone. You can&#8217;t do more than
that.
<!--l. 11538--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11540--><p class="noindent" ><span

expressions of freedom may take time to appear, but they are
already there. Do not expect perfection. There is no perfection in
manifestation. Details must clash. No problem is solved completely,
but you can withdraw from it to a level on which it does not
operate.

<!--l. 11544--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Questioner: </span>How does the jnani proceed when he needs something to
be done? Does he make plans, decide about details and execute
them?
<!--l. 11546--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Maharaj: </span>Jnani understands a situation fully and knows at once what
needs be done. That is all.
<!--l. 11548--><p class="noindent" >The rest happens by itself, and to a large extent unconsciously.
The jnani&#8217;s identity with all that is, is so complete, that as he
responds to the universe, so does the universe respond to him. He is
supremely confident that once a situation has been cognised,
events will move in adequate response. The ordinary man is
personally concerned, he counts his risks and chances, while the jnani
remains aloof, sure that all will happen as it must; and it does
not matter much what happens, for ultimately the return to
balance and harmony is inevitable. The heart of things is at
peace.
<!--l. 11550--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I have understood that personality is an illusion, and alert
detachment, without loss of identity, is our point of contact with the

self-aware identity?
<!--l. 11552--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am both. But the real self cannot be described except in terms
supplied by the person, in terms of what I am not. All you can tell
about the person is not the self, and you can tell nothing about the
self, which would not refer to the person; as it is, as it could be, as it
should be. All attributes are personal. The real is beyond all
attributes.
<!--l. 11554--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you sometimes the self and sometimes the person?

<!--l. 11556--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>How can I be? The person is what I appear to be to other

succession.

real to us?
<!--l. 11560--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You, the self, being the root of all being, consciousness and joy,
impart your reality to whatever you perceive. This imparting of reality
takes place invariably in the now, at no other time, because
past and future are only in the mind. &#8216;Being&#8217; applies to the now
only.

<!--l. 11564--><p class="noindent" ><span

the now. We miss it because the mind is ever shuttling between the
past and the future. It will not stop to focus the now. It can be done
with comparative ease, if interest is aroused.

<!--l. 11572--><p class="noindent" ><span

one&#8217;s desires and fears as soon as they arise.

<!--l. 11580--><p class="noindent" ><span

remedy lies in clarity and integrity of thinking. Try to understand that
you live in a world of illusions, examine them and uncover their roots.
The very attempt to do so will make you earnest, for there is bliss in
right endeavour.

class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To realise the immovable means to become immovable. And the
purpose is the good of all that lives.
<!--l. 11662--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Life is movement. Immobility is death. Of what use is death to
life?
<!--l. 11664--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>I am talking of immovability, not of immobility. You become
immovable in reticence. You become a power which gets all things
right. It may or may not imply intense outward activity, but the mind

remains deep and quiet.
<!--l. 11666--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>As I watch my mind I find it changing all the time, mood
succeeding mood in infinite variety, while you seem to be perpetually in
the same mood of cheerful benevolence.
<!--l. 11668--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Moods are in the mind and do not matter. Go within, go beyond.
Cease being fascinated by the content of your consciousness. When you
reach the deep layers of your true being, you will find that the mind&#8217;s
surface-play affects you very little.
<!--l. 11670--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There will be play all the same?
<!--l. 11672--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>A quiet mind is not a dead mind.
<!--l. 11674--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Consciousness is always in movement &#8211; it is an observable fact.
Immovable consciousness is a contradiction. When you talk of a quiet
mind, what is it? Is not mind the same as consciousness?
<!--l. 11676--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>We must remember that words are used in many ways, according to
the context. The fact is that there is little difference between the
conscious and the unconscious &#8212; they are essentially the same. The
waking state differs from deep sleep in the presence of the witness. A
ray of awareness illumines a part of our mind and that part becomes
our dream or waking consciousness, while awareness appears as the
witness. The witness usually knows only consciousness. Sadhana
consists in the witness turning back first on his conscious, then upon
himself in his own awareness.
<!--l. 11678--><p class="noindent" >Self-awareness is Yoga.
<!--l. 11680--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If awareness is all-pervading, then a blind man, once realised, can
see?

<!--l. 11682--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are mixing sensation with awareness. The jnani knows himself
as he is. He is also aware of his body being crippled and his mind being
deprived of a range of sensory perceptions. But he is not affected by the
availability of eyesight, nor by its absence.
<!--l. 11684--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>My question is more specific; when a blind man becomes a jnani
will his eyesight be restored to him or not?
<!--l. 11686--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Unless his eyes and brain undergo a renovation, how can he
see?
<!--l. 11688--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>But will they undergo a renovation?
<!--l. 11690--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>They may or may not. It all depends on destiny and grace. But a
jnani commands a mode of spontaneous, non-sensory perception, which
makes him know things directly, without the intermediary of
the senses. He is beyond the perceptual and the conceptual,
beyond the categories of time and space, name and shape. He
is neither the perceived nor the perceiver, but the simple and
the universal factor that makes perceiving possible. Reality is
within consciousness, but it is not consciousness nor any of its
contents.
<!--l. 11692--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What is false, the world, or my knowledge of it?
<!--l. 11694--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Is there a world outside your knowledge? Can you go beyond what
you know? You may postulate a world beyond the
<!--l. 11696--><p class="noindent" >mind, but it will remain a concept, unproved and unprovable. Your
experience is your proof, and it is valid for you only. Who else can have
your experience, when the other person is only as real as he appears in
your experience?
<!--l. 11698--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Am I so hopelessly lonely?

<!--l. 11700--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are. as a person. In your real being vow are the whole.
<!--l. 11702--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>Are you a part of the world which I have in consciousness, or are
you independent?
<!--l. 11704--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>What you see is yours and what I see is mine. The two have little
in common.
<!--l. 11706--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>There must be some common factor which unites us.
<!--l. 11708--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>To find the common factor you must abandon all distinctions. Only
the universal is in common.
<!--l. 11710--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>What strikes me as exceedingly strange is that while you say that I
am merely a product of my memories and woefully limited, I create a
vast and rich world in which. everything is contained, including you
and your teaching. How this vastness is created and contained in my
smallness is what I find hard to understand. May be you are
giving me the whole truth, but I am grasping only a small part of
it.
<!--l. 11712--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Yet, it is a fact &#8211; the small projects the whole, but it cannot
contain the whole. However great and complete is your world it is
self-contradictory and transitory and altogether illusory.
<!--l. 11714--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>It may be illusory yet it is marvellous. When I look and listen,
touch, smell and taste, think and feel, remember and imagine, I cannot
but be astonished at my miraculous creativity. I look through a
microscope or telescope and see wonders, I follow the track of an atom
and hear the whisper of the stars. If I am the sole creator of all this,
then I am God indeed! But if I am God, why do I appear so small and
helpless to myself?
<!--l. 11716--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You are God, but you do not know it.

<!--l. 11718--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>If I am God, then the world I create must be true.
<!--l. 11720--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>It is true in essence, but not in appearance. Be free of desires and
fears and at once your vision will clear and you shall see all things as
they are. Or, you may say that the satoguna creates the world, the
tamoguna obscures it and the rajoguna distorts.
<!--l. 11722--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>This does not tell me much, because if I ask what are the
gunas, the answer will be: what creates &#8211; what obscures &#8211; what
distorts. The fact remains &#8211; something unbelievable happened
to me, and I do not understand what has happened, how and
why.
<!--l. 11724--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Well, wonder is the dawn of wisdom. To be steadily and
consistently wondering is sadhana.
<!--l. 11726--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>I am in a world which I do not understand and therefore, I am
afraid of it. This is everybody&#8217;s experience.
<!--l. 11728--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>You have separated yourself from the world, therefore it
pains and frightens you. Discover your mistake and be free of
fear.
<!--l. 11730--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>You are asking me to give up the world, while I want to be happy in
the world.
<!--l. 11732--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>If you ask for the impossible, who can help you? The limited is
bound to be painful and pleasant in turns. If you seek real happiness,
unassailable and unchangeable, you must leave the world with its pains
and pleasures behind you.
<!--l. 11734--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">Q: </span>How is it done?
<!--l. 11736--><p class="noindent" ><span
class="cmbx-10">M: </span>Mere physical renunciation is only a token of earnestness, but

earnestness alone does not liberate. There must be understanding
which comes with alert perceptivity, eager enquiry and deep
investigation. You must work relentlessly for your salvation from sin
and sorrow.
<!--l. 11738--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 11745--><p class="noindent" >In the humble abode of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, but for the electric
lights and the noises of the street traffic, one would not know in which
period of human history one dwells. There is an atmosphere of
timelessness about his tiny room; the subjects discussed are
timeless &#8211; valid for all times; the way they are expounded and
examined is also timeless; the centuries, millennia and yugas fall off
and one deals with matters immensely ancient and eternally
new.
<!--l. 11747--><p class="noindent" >The discussions held and teachings given would have been the same ten
thousand years ago and will be the same ten thousand years hence.
There will always be conscious beings wondering about the fact of their
being conscious and enquiring into its cause and aim. Whence am I?
Who am I?
<!--l. 11749--><p class="noindent" >Whither am I? Such questions have no beginning and no end. And it is
crucial to know the answers, for without a full understanding of
oneself, both in time and in timelessness, life is but a dream,
imposed on us by powers we do not know, for purposes we cannot
grasp.
<!--l. 11751--><p class="noindent" >Maharaj is not a learned. There is no erudition behind his homely
Marathi; authorities he does not quote, scriptures are rarely
mentioned; the astonishingly rich spiritual heritage of India is
implicit in him rather than explicit. No rich Ashram was ever built
around him and most of his followers are humble working people
cherishing the opportunity of spending an hour with him from time to
time.
<!--l. 11753--><p class="noindent" >Simplicity and humility are the keynotes of his life and teachings;

physically and inwardly he never takes the higher seat; the essence of
being on which he talks, he sees in others as clearly as he sees it in
himself. He admits that while he is aware of it, others are not yet, but
this difference is temporary and of little importance, except to the
mind and its ever-changing content. When asked about his Yoga, he
says he has none to offer, no system t propound, no theology,
cosmology, psychology or philosophy. He knows the real nature &#8211;
his own and his listeners&#8217; &#8211; and he points it out. The listener
cannot see it because he cannot see the obvious, simply and
directly. All he knows, he knows with his mind, stimulated with
the senses. That the mind is a sense in itself, he does not even
suspect.
<!--l. 11755--><p class="noindent" >The Nisarga Yoga, the &#8216;natural&#8217; Yoga of Maharaj, is disconcertingly
simple &#8211; the mind, which is all-becoming, must recognise and penetrate
its own being, not as being this or that, here or there, then or now, but
just as timeless being.
<!--l. 11757--><p class="noindent" >This timeless being is the source of both life and consciousness. In
terms of time, space and causation it is all-powerful, being the causeless
cause; all-pervading, eternal, in the sense of being beginningless,
endless and ever-present. Uncaused, it is free; all-pervading, it knows;
undivided, it is happy. It lives, it loves, and it has endless fun, shaping
and re-shaping the universe. Every man has it, every man is it, but not
all know themselves as they are, and therefore identify themselves with
the name and shape of their bodies and the contents of their
consciousness.
<!--l. 11759--><p class="noindent" >To rectify this misunderstanding of one&#8217;s reality, the only way is to take
full cognisance of the ways of one&#8217;s mind and to turn it into an
instrument of self-discovery. The mind was originally a tool in the
struggle for biological survival. It had to learn the laws and ways of
Nature working hand-in-hand can raise life to a higher level. But, in
the process the mind acquired the art of symbolic thinking and

communication, the art and skill of language. Words became
important. Ideas and abstractions acquired an appearance of reality,
the conceptual replaced the real, with the result that man now
lives in a verbal world, crowded with words and dominated by
words.
<!--l. 11761--><p class="noindent" >Obviously, for dealing with things and people words are exceedingly
useful. But they make us live in a world totally symbolic and, therefore,
unreal. To break out from this prison of the verbal mind into reality,
one must be able to shift one&#8217;s focus from the word to what it refers to,
the thing itself.
<!--l. 11763--><p class="noindent" >The most commonly used word and most pregnant with feelings, and
ideas is the word &#8216;I&#8217;. Mind tends to include in it anything and
everything, the body as well as the Absolute. In practice it stands as a
pointer to an experience which is direct, immediate and immensely
significant. To be, and to know that one is, is most important.
And to be of interest, a thing must be related to one&#8217;s conscious
existence, which is the focal point of every desire and fear. For, the
ultimate aim of every desire is to enhance and intensify this
sense of existence, while all fear is, in its essence, the fear of
self-extinction.
<!--l. 11765--><p class="noindent" >To delve into the sense of &#8216;I&#8217; &#8211; so real and vital &#8211; in order to reach its
source is the core of Nisarga Yoga. Not being continuous, the sense of
&#8216;I&#8217; must have a source from which it flows and to which it returns. This
timeless source of conscious being is what Maharaj calls the self-nature,
self-being, swarupa.
<!--l. 11767--><p class="noindent" >As to the methods of realising one&#8217;s supreme identity with self-being,
Maharaj is peculiarly non-committal. He says that each has his own
way to reality, and that there can be no general rule. But, for all the
gateway to reality, by whatever road one arrives to it, is the
sense of &#8216;I am&#8217;. It is through grasping the full import of the &#8216;I

am&#8217;, and going beyond it to its source, that one can realise the
supreme state, which is also the primordial and the ultimate. The
difference between the beginning and the end lies only in the
mind. When the mind is dark or turbulent, the source is not
perceived.
<!--l. 11769--><p class="noindent" >When it is clear and luminous, it becomes a faithful reflection of
the source. The source is always the same &#8211; beyond darkness
and light, beyond life and death, beyond the conscious and the
unconscious.
<!--l. 11771--><p class="noindent" >This dwelling on the sense &#8216;I am&#8217; is the simple, easy and natural Yoga,
the Nisarga Yoga. There is no secrecy in it and no dependence; no
preparation is required and no initiation. Whoever is puzzled
by his very existence as a conscious being and earnestly wants
to find his own source, can grasp the ever-present sense of &#8216;I
am&#8217; and dwell on it assiduously and patiently, till the clouds
obscuring the mind dissolve and the heart of being is seen in all its
glory.
<!--l. 11773--><p class="noindent" >The Nisarga Yoga, when persevered in and brought to its fruition,
results in one becoming conscious and active in what one always was
unconsciously and passively. There is no difference in kind &#8211; only in
manner &#8211; the difference between a lump of gold and a glorious
ornament shaped out of it. Life goes on, but it is spontaneous and free,
meaningful and happy.
<!--l. 11775--><p class="noindent" >Maharaj most lucidly describes this natural, spontaneous state, but as
the man born blind cannot visualise light and colours, so is the
unenlightened mind unable to give meaning to such descriptions.
Expressions like dispassionate happiness, affectionate detachment,
timelessness and causelessness of things and being &#8211; they all sound
strange and cause no response. Intuitively we feel they have a deep
meaning, and they even create in us a strange longing for the ineffable,

a forerunner of things to come, but that is all. As Maharaj puts it:
words are pointers, they show the direction but they will not come
along with us. Truth is the fruit of earnest action, words merely point
the way.

 id="x1-108000B"></a>Navnath Sampradaya</h2>
<!--l. 11782--><p class="noindent" >Hinduism comprises numerous sects, creeds and cults and the origin of
most of them is lost in antiquity. The Nath Sampradaya, later known
as the Navnath Sampradaya, is one of them. Some scholars are
of the view that this sect originated with the teachings of the
mythical Rishi Dattatreya, who is believed to be a combined
incarnation of the holy trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The
unique spiritual attainments of this legendary figure are mentioned
in the Bhagavata Purana, the Mahabharata and also in some
later Upanishads. Others hold that it is an offshoot of the Hatha
Yoga.
<!--l. 11784--><p class="noindent" >Whatever be its origin, the teachings of the Nath Sampradaya have,
over the centuries, become labyrinthine in complexity and have
assumed different forms in different parts of India. Some Gurus of the
Sampradaya lay stress on bhakti, devotion; others on jnana,
knowledge; still others on yoga, the union with the ultimate. In
the fourteenth century we find Svatmarama Svami, the great
Hathayogin, bemoaning &#8216;the darkness arising out of multiplicity of
opinions&#8217; to displel which he lit the lamp of his famous work
Hathayogapradipika.
<!--l. 11786--><p class="noindent" >According to some learned commentators, the Nath Gurus propound
that the entire creation is born out of nada (sound), the divine
principle, and bindu (light), the physical principle and the Supreme
Reality from which these two principles emanate is Shiva. Liberation
according to them is merging of the soul into Shiva through
the process of laya, dissolution of the human ego, the sense of
I-ness.
<!--l. 11788--><p class="noindent" >In the day-to-day instructions to their devotees, however, the Nath

Gurus seldom refer to the metaphysics discovered by the scholars in
their teachings. In fact their approach is totally non-metaphysical,
simple and direct. While the chanting of sacred hyms and devotional
songs as well as the worship of the idols is a traditional feature of the
sect, its teaching emphasises that the Supreme Reality can be realised
only within the heart.
<!--l. 11790--><p class="noindent" >The Nath Sampradaya came to be known as Navnath Sampradaya
when sometime in the remote past, the followers of the sect chose nine
of their early Gurus as examplars of their creed. Bur there is no
unanimity regarding the names of these nine Masters. The most widely
accepted list however is as follows:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li
  class="enumerate" id="x1-108002x1">Matsyendranath
     </li>
     <li
  class="enumerate" id="x1-108004x2">Gorakhnath
     </li>
     <li
  class="enumerate" id="x1-108006x3">Jalandharnath
     </li>
     <li
  class="enumerate" id="x1-108008x4">Kantinath
     </li>
     <li
  class="enumerate" id="x1-108010x5">Gahininath
     </li>
     <li
  class="enumerate" id="x1-108012x6">Bhartrinath
     </li>
     <li
  class="enumerate" id="x1-108014x7">Revananath
     </li>
     <li
  class="enumerate" id="x1-108016x8">Charpatnath

     </li>
     <li
  class="enumerate" id="x1-108018x9">Naganath</li></ol>
<!--l. 11804--><p class="noindent" >Of these nine Masters, Gahaninath and Revananath had large
followings in the southern part of India, including Maharashtra, the
state to which Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj belongs. Revananath is said to
have founded a sub-sect of his own and chose Kadasiddha as his chief
disciple and successor. The latter initiated Lingajangam Maharaj and
Bhausahib Maharaj and entrusted to their care his Ashram and the
propagation of his teaching. Bhausahib Maharaj later established what
came to be known as Inchegeri Sampradaya, a new movement
within the traditional fold. Among his disciples were Amburao
Maharaj, Girimalleshwar Maharaj, Siddharameshwar Maharaj
and the noted philosopher Dr. R. D. Renade. Sri Nisargadatta
Maharaj is the direct disciple and successor of Siddharameshwar
Maharaj.
<!--l. 11806--><p class="noindent" >It may be mentioned here that, though officially the current Guru of
the Inchegeri branch of the Navnath Sampradaya, Sri Nisargadatta
does not seem to attach much importance to sects, cults and creeds,
including his own. In answer to a questioner whi wished to join the
Navnath Sampradaya he said: &#8221;The Navnath Sampradaya is only a
tradition, a way of teaching and practice.
<!--l. 11808--><p class="noindent" >It does not denote a level of consciousness. If you accept a Navnath
Sampradaya teacher as your Guru, you join his Sampradaya... Your
belonging is a matter of your own feeling and conviction.
<!--l. 11810--><p class="noindent" >After all it is all verbal and formal. In reality there is neither Guru nor
disciple, neither theory nor practice, neither ignorance nor realisation.
It all depends upon what you take yourself to be. Know yourself
correctly. There is no substitute for self-knowledge&#8221;

<!--l. 11812--><p class="noindent" >The teaching of Nath Sampradaya offers the seeker the royal road to
liberation, a road in which all the four by-lanes of bhakti, jnana, karma
and dhyana of Lord Shiva, in his hagiography, entitled Nathlingamrita,
claims that the path shown by the Nath sect is the best of all and it
leads to direct liberation.
