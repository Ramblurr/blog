    <h1>The Shock of Arrival<a href="http://picoiyerjourneys.com/index.php/2009/01/the-shock-of-arrival/">*</a></h1>
<p>Slowly, the plane begins to descend, lower, still lower, till the pattern of fields and roads, visible from above, becomes a particular tree, a slow-moving car, a figure on a sidewalk. There is a sudden bump, a violent deceleration, and then you are out, in a slap of tropical air, the smell of clove cigarettes and frangipani piquant, the heat palpable and strange.<br />
There are figures waving from inside the airport building, and when you come out the other side, you are in a car, driving through the dark, the sound of gamelan music in the trees, a chattering all around, occasionally a sudden face lit up by the headlights.</p>
<p>Then out into the streets, at dead of night, or just before dawn (you hardly notice), and everything seeming brighter, more vivid than it will ever seem again: the little lights, the streets without names, the stalls selling mangoes, the men calling from the shadows. In those early, virgin moments, you are wide-open, ready (in all senses) to be taken in.</p>
<p>No drug I can imagine, few love-affairs I might dream of, can match that simple, shocking excitement of arriving in a truly foreign place. It is akin to the first kiss, the first date, all the firsts that have an intensity and life disproportionate to their duration; the first moment is worth a thousand others. Even now, after twelve years of living on and off in Japan, what I remember most, with the fiercest ache and pang, and what changed my life irreversibly (and brought me here, in fact), is just the one-night stopover, on my way to Southeast Asia, that was my first taste of Japan. The quiet, slightly melancholy autumn morning, the scale of things&#8211;shoes laid neatly outside tatami houses&#8211;the elegance of calligraphy on white background and temple spire against blue sky, the whole unexpected shine to the air, impressed themselves on me with a force that can never (by definition) come again. You can never, as Heraclitus (or, perhaps, one of his followers) said, step in the same river twice.</p>
<p>Arrivals come in a rainbow of colors&#8211;the sight of the ancient city across the plains, the slow drawing into a harbor as the figures on shore grow larger, and larger, till they’re human-scaled, the night-time wander through a gleaming labyrinth of airport passageways, the flight along the Himalayas, snowcapped under blue, blue skies, as you come into Kathmandu. And all are given shape and texture by where they sit in the topography of your life: an arrival back home, or in a lover’s arms, an arrival at the place you’ve dreamed of for too long.</p>
<p>But nearly all of them, in my experience, come with an exaltation of novelty and wonder, outpouring and relief, that nothing else can quite efface; they are the foundations for one’s perception of a place, which subsequent events and understandings will only revise, refine and perhaps correct. My unfailing rule, whenever I want to write on a place, or truly to experience it, is simply to walk and walk and walk, wherever whim summons me, for as much of the first twenty-four hours as possible, in that state of first encounter when I will take in everything&#8211;my feet scarcely on the ground&#8211;and everything will seem new and strange to me. Few events, if any, in the next twenty-four days, will make so deep an impression.</p>
<p>This shock of first meeting does not have to be a pleasant one. I remember once, years ago, flying in over the thick jungle, to Suriname, as a teenager alone on the road, and seeing nothing but an unbroken canopy of trees. We touched down, I looked around, and realized I&#8217;d arrived at a dead end: jungle everywhere, a small unlit town in the middle, and almost nowhere for a solitary boy to go or stay. I quickly tried to leave Suriname, but each day I was bounced off the one departing flight, in favor of some more prosperous V.I.P. Day after day, I sat in the airport&#8211;I’d never arrived, in some sense&#8211;and when it closed, hauled my suitcase out to the jungle and spent the night there, waiting for release.</p>
<p>There is a quality of dream, ideally, to arrivals after long journeys, and with all that has been lost as carriages and ocean liners and long-distance trains have given way to supersonic planes, something has been gained, in the simple jolt of flying from New York, say, to Bangkok, in a few hours, and changing seasons and centuries in a moment. We lose a part of our rational faculties, the wide-awakeness that is our usual guiding light; but something else in us, closer to the dark, comes awake. Bleary, confused and not sure if we are here or there, we walk without defenses through a province of the imagination. Part of us is in mid-air, and the rest is not quite sure what to make of the whispers from across the street, the generous smiles, the coins that could be pounds or could be pennies.</p>
<p>Later we will return, and photograph for the neighbors the Taj Mahal by moonlight; first, though, and unforgettably, we will encounter the bodies along the road, the campfires in the unlit night, the urchins grabbing at one’s sleeve outside the Taj Mahal Hotel.</p>

<p>In practice, of course, and on the level of one’s official self, our arrivals in a very foreign place are mediated by the St. Peters who guard the gates to their secular heavens. The men in uniform thumbing through one’s passport; the customs inspectors in Havana, taking one’s papers off to read them in a private office; the men in Ottawa looking at the Arabic stamps in my passport and taking the hasty scribbles in my notebook for Quranic sura. Arrivals are among the most bureaucratized, and often anguished, moments in our journeys, as strangers look over one’s identity&#8211;one’s possessions&#8211;and then release one into a chaos where smiling men are offering taxis, night-tours, girls, and one can’t tell east from west.</p>
<p>Parting, wrote Emily Dickinson, is all we know of heaven, and all we need of hell; but arrival has something of that quality, too, as the natural home of hucksters trying to cash in on our fresh bewilderment.</p>
<p>At the hotel, there are more forms to fill out, passport numbers to transcribe, uncertainties about whether to tip, and how much. Even as one is entering the soul of a place, in its nakedest form, another part of one is tilting against its official side, guarded by paperwork. Part of the special promise of arrivals comes from the fact that one’s making wrong turns and misreading the signs and taking the coil of mosquito repellent by the bed for incense.<br />
The history of travel-writing is, not surprisingly, a history of such encounters&#8211;Peter Quennell, say, on stepping onto foreign soil for the first time, finding &#8220;a tall gaunt African, stalking down the quayside wearing long linen robes and a round, embroidered cap, while a crowd of ragged street&#8211;urchins scurried after him and threw stones&#8221;; or the travelers in Paul Bowles’s Sheltering Sky, left (in the movie version) with their trunks on a vast and empty dock that will prefigure the desert where their identities are swallowed up. Arrivals are the time when we are at our most responsive and most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Yet for those reasons (arrivals take place not in the logical part of us, but somewhere else), they do not conform to expectation. &#8220;When we reached Needles,&#8221; Christopher Isherwood wrote in May 1939, traveling across America by bus, &#8220;a patriotic lady passenger began to sing, `California, here I come!’ It seemed little enough to arrive at, after such a journey.&#8221; Three sentences later, he notes, &#8220;Towards evening, we came into downtown Los Angeles-perhaps the ugliest city on earth.&#8221; The first thing to note here is that he is probably right; the second is that he ended up living in the infernal place for almost fifty years, and finding in it his own private salvation. Yet he never wrote more powerfully of it than on that first day: &#8220;I was amazed at the size of the city, and at its lack of shape. There seemed no reason why it should ever stop &#8230;what the arriving traveller first sees are merely advertisements for a city which doesn’t exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first sentence of Lafcadio Hearn’s piece, &#8220;My First Day in the Orient,&#8221; quotes a &#8220;kind English professor&#8221; whom he met soon after his arrival in Japan, telling him, &#8220;Do not fail to write down your first impressions as soon as possible &#8230;They are evanescent, you know: they will never come to you again, once they have faded out; and yet of all the strange sensations you may receive in this country you will feel none so charming as these.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearn confesses that he ignored this advice in his rush of excitement at meeting Japan, and yet nothing he wrote about the country he came to love and immortalize ever matches his description of that opening day, when he was held spellbound by the swarming characters, the &#8220;fantastic riddles written over everything,&#8221; the presence of &#8220;forty millions of the most lovable people in the universe.&#8221; He recognizes, shrewdly, that much of what he is seeing is inside his own imagination&#8211;&#8221;Hokusai’s own figures walking about in straw rain-coats&#8221;-—-yet, like an Isherwood in reverse, he is taken by a &#8220;romance of reality&#8221; that will fade only when honeymoon turns to marriage.</p>
<p>He asks his ricksha-driver to take him to a temple, and ends up back at his European hotel; he finally approaches an altar in a shrine, and what he sees there is a mirror.</p>

<p>A large part of the magic and suspendedness of arrivals comes, I think, from the fact that they play havoc with tenses; in that initial encounter&#8211;the exhilarated blue morning that Hearn experiences&#8211;the past itself is erased (unless it comes back as deja vu), and one is in an intensity of the present, with the future all around (&#8220;Anticipation!&#8221; is how it hits the talented Mr. Ripley, in the Patricia Highsmith novel of the same name as, on the run from the police, he takes a languid walk around the city of Palermo. &#8220;It occurred to him that his anticipation was more pleasant to him than his experiencing&#8221;). A large part of arrival consists in seeing some of the things that you will later come to know, and not seeing others (like love at first sight again, or the first kiss). Hence Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous dictum; &#8220;To travel hopefully is better than to arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arrival puts us back, ideally, in a child’s sense of everlastingness, a future without boundaries. And, conversely, home is the place that will never excite one in the same way precisely because so much of what it means lies in the past; it is the place where one can never arrive for the first time (for me, for example, the one place that can never be exciting to arrive in is England, where I was born, because every trip there has the feel of backwards motion, akin to the sensation of slipping in the back door to the family kitchen). Arrival can only be complicated by expectation, or compromised by it even, as we step off the train in Venice to find it crowded with touts and crowds and thousands of tourists who’ve stepped out in the same spirit as ourselves.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, arrival works on us like a spirit&#8211;the very epitome of a foreign influence&#8211;and many of us grow addicted to it. I still live on the memory of passing between great headlands, under a blue-black sky, in the Ionian Sea seventeen years ago, and easing into a foreign harbor after night had fallen, with just a string of lights along the water, the sound of music from tavernas and the darkened hills behind. &#8220;Magic,&#8221; as D.H. Lawrence writes, &#8220;are high lands seen from the sea, when they are far, far off, and ghostly translucent like ice-bergs.&#8221; Lawrence himself became of all travelers the most captive to arrivals because, I think, he was so committed to living in a state of white-hot intensity. For years, on his &#8220;sacred pilgrimage,&#8221; he’d arrive in Australia, or Sicily, or Ceylon, or New Mexico, and get to its heart almost instantly, his prose and his being aflame. Then, having exhausted it within a few days (and found it wasn’t all he wanted), he’d take off again, on a course that could have no conclusion except in his mind.</p>
<p>All of this bears out how much of our arrivals take place inside of us, and how that always treacherous relationship between a visitor and his subject finds its greatest intensity there (of intoxication, of disappointment). Arrivals are at least half about what we bring to the places we see&#8211;the mirror in the altar again&#8211;and when the shipwrecked crew from Milan steps ashore on Prospero’s island (in The Tempest), each member sees, in the same place, a reflection of his longings. Kindly Gonzalo descries the outlines of a Golden Age, while Sebastian and Antonio see an opportunity for seizing power; Stephano and Trinculo spot a chance for getting sozzled. Their destination a kind of magic reflecting glass, all of them are arriving at a different shore in their imaginations (&#8220;The air breathes upon us here most sweetly,&#8221; innocent Adrian pronounces, to which the murderous Sebastian says, &#8220;As if it had lungs, and rotten ones&#8221;).</p>
<p>Once we’re on solid ground, we embark upon the sadder, more responsible task of domesticating the place and putting a name on things, gradually improving on (or dispensing with) our first preconceptions, and coming to find a way around the dream. We learn to read a few of the signs, we come to superimpose a map on streets, we harden into theories, into habits. Gradually, in fact, we move from summer into autumn, and towards the deeper, slower journey that ends, as Eliot writes, when we &#8220;arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thrill of arrival shades towards the more complex feelings of departure (which have less height, more weight to them). Departures are felt more than remembered, often; they don’t linger in the mind with the great flameburst of arrival, but reside in a different part, full of feelings mixed and suppressed, the divided pulls that reach towards the morning after.</p>
<p>That is why all the important arrivals in our life, when we stop to think of them, are enigmatic, in a way, and wear the shadow of other departures. In his strange, great book, The Enigma of Arrival, V.S. Naipaul writes explicitly about the sensation of arriving in the England he’d been visiting in his imagination all his life (reading Hardy and Shakespeare in distant Trinidad, and taking Britain&#8211;the heart of Empire&#8211;to be the center of the civilized world). He’s not traveling light, of course (what place could live up to such a boy’s imaginings ?), and what he begins to find, and honestly to record, is that sensation we all know: namely, that, like Zeno’s arrow, we never, at some level, seem to arrive. The moment we achieve the position we’ve always wanted&#8211;become the C.E.O., the partner of Miss Right, the best player on the block&#8211;that place of arrival suddenly looks commonplace (entangled in realities), and the imagination retreats to fashion a new set of objectives. Like the moment, the dream of arrival slips by before you’ve noticed it&#8211;becomes a part of everyday life&#8211;and you remember that the only place where you’ll fully arrive is the period that comes at the end of your life sentence.</p>
<p>In The Enigma of Arrival, it takes Naipaul one hundred pages to circle back to the climactic moment of his arrival in England, and, even then, he arrives first in a New York he hadn’t reckoned with, and then in an England that doesn’t look at all like the place he’d read about. The Earls Court where he begins to live is full of other new arrivals&#8211;arrivistes, like himself&#8211;and when finally, many years later, he can more truly say he’s arrived, it’s only because the moments pass so easily that he hardly notices them (or where he is). He knows he’s finally arrived in England, not because he will always live there, but because it is there that he will die.</p>
