    <h1>Aitareya Brahmana on Pilgrimage</h1>
<p>Flower like are the heels of the wanderer<br />
Thus his body grows and is fruitful<br />
All his sins disappear<br />
Slain by the toil of his journeying.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#10023;&#10023;&#10023;&#10023;</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is no happiness for him who does not travel!<br />
Thus we have heard. Living in the society of men,<br />
the best of men becomes a sinner.<br />
Therefore, wander!<br />
The feet of the wanderer are like the flower, his soul<br />
is growing and reaping the fruit; and all his sins are<br />
destroyed by his fatigues in wandering.<br />
Therefore, wander!<br />
The fortune of him who is sitting, sits; it rises when<br />
he rises; it sleeps when he sleeps; it moves when he moves.<br />
Therefore, wander!
