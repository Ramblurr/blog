<h1>On Tramp</h1>

<h3>Excerpt from <a href="https://archive.org/details/manadriftbeingle00kennrich" title="A Man Adrift"><u>A Man Adrift</u> (1900)</a></h3>

<p>To be penniless and on tramp Is a curious experience. You care for no one, and no one cares for you. Things about you seem vague and elusive. You are in a mental chaos. You are a link dissevered from the human chain. And you wander hardly knowing or caring where you wander.</p>

<p>As you shuffle along people glance at you as they pass. Scorn is in their eyes, for you are a man without a home—a man without friends. You are dispirited, dirty, and without self-respect. The aphorism that the world owes every man a living does not apply to you.</p>

<p>You haven't spirit enough to steal; you haven't continuity of mind enough to plan a course of action. Your thoughts waver. You will forget where and how you began to think. Projects will come up before you, and they will fade before you grasp them. If you had force enough in you you would hate everything and everybody. You would feel hard, sharp resentment. You would like to do murder, to rob, to destroy. You would like to hold the world in the hollow of your hand so that you might crush it.</p>

<p>But you are impotent—your pulse is down—you shuffle along.</p>

<p>Who you are or what you were matters not. You may be a man with a past, you may be a man with a future. You may be one who has belonged to the topmost class; you may be a labourer, or a man from out the filth of the slums, or a dispirited low-down thief.</p>

<p>And you beg for bread. You knock at the doors of houses and ask for something to eat, or you ask alms of stray, passing men. It may have been that at one time in your life you would have thought it impossible for you to beg. You would have shuddered at the bare idea. How shameful! You would have thought that death would be preferable. If a man had said that you would come to this you would have struck him in the face. Perhaps when you did think of able-bodied men begging you thought of them as wretches hardly worth the powder and ball it would take to kill them.</p>

<p>You feel sad.</p>

<p>Still there are times when a fine moment comes to you. It may be that you will feel the curious sense of power that belongs to utter loneliness. It may be that you will feel the sense of freedom that comes from a total lack of responsibility. No one is dependent upon you. No one is waiting for you. If people have a contempt for you, at least they let you alone. And this is something.</p>

<p>You are thrown in upon yourself. For the first time in your life, perhaps, you really begin to know who and what you are. You are interested in the strange unfoldings of yourself. You have dreams and fancies and curious longings. A world opens to you within yourself. And you walk on and on, bearing with you a wonderful dream world.</p>

<p>What matters to you the contempt of people who move in grooves, who themselves fear the opinions of others ? After all, they will die, even as you will die.</p>

<p>Yes, they will die in a day. They will come to dust. For you the sun shines as it shines for them. For you the water flows as it flows for them. In common with them you have the air to breathe. In common with them you can see the strange pictures in the clouds. In common with them you can move and think and see and hear.</p>

<p>In moments when these thoughts are with you, you move along with a brisk step—you ask for bread without shame.</p>
