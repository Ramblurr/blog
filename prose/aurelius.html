    <h1>Marcus Aurelius: The Meditations (167 CE) <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/world_civ/worldcivreader/world_civ_reader_1/aurelius.html">*</a></h1>
    <p> Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, at the seashore, and in the mountains; and you tend to desire such things very much. But this is a characteristic of the most common sort of men, for it is in your power whenever you will to choose to retreat into yourself. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retreat than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately perfectly tranquil; and I affirm that tranquillity is nothing other than the proper ordering of the mind.</p>

    <p>Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.</p>

<p>Think of your many years of procrastination; how the gods have repeatedly granted you further periods of grace, of which you have taken no advantage. It is time now to realise the nature of the universe to which you belong, and of that controlling Power whose offspring you are; and to understand that your time has a limit set to it. Use it, then, to advance your enlightenment; or it will be gone, and never in your power again.</p>
