Title: The Breath of Night

                                The Breath of Night

It is the time of evening when the rays of the setting sun pass through an air
already cooled by the first breath of night, while the mud walls give off the
heat they have stored all during the day. Indoors it is like being in an oven.
You must be outside, and feel the touch of the first shadows. And for a long
time I lie idly stretched out staring up into the depths of the sky, listening
to the last sounds from the /zaouiya/ and the /ksar/: doors creaking as they
swing heavily shut, the neighing of horses, and the bleat of sheep on the
roofs. And the little African donkeys bray, a sound as sad as the protracted
sobbing. And the sharp thin voices of the black women.

Nearby in the courtyard there is the sound of tambourines and guinbris, making an accompaniment to some very strange vocalizations. These seem less like music than like the cries uttered during love-making. Sometimes the voices die down and all is silent. Then the blood in the veins speaks, by itself.

Soon life starts up again. Mats, rugs, and sacks appear on the roofs of the
slave-quarters. The ear still listens for muffled noises, kitchen sounds,
arguments going on in low voices, prayers being murmured. And the sense of
smell is jarred by the odors in the smoke that rises from the confusion of
black bodies below, where the flames flicker joyously in the braziers. There
are other silhouettes in the doorways of the holy men. It is all here, the
daily life of the /ksar/, like something I have always known, and yet always
new.

Over toward the right, behind the Mellah, there is a patch of wall that remains
lighted up until very late. Its reddish surface serves as backdrop for the
curious plays of shadow that are projected upon it. At times they move back and
forth slowly, and then they seem to go unto a furious dance. After all other
voices have grown silent and everyone roundabout has gone to sleep, the
Aissaoua are still awake. As the night grows perceptibly cooler, the members of
that enlightened brotherhood, the /khouan/, pound on the tambourine and draw
strident sounds from the oboelike rhaita. They also sing, slowly, as if in
a dream. And they dance beside the flaming pots of charcoal, their wet bodies
moving to an ever-accelerating tempo. From the fires rise intoxicating fumes of
benzoin and myrrh. Through ecstasy they hope to reach the final target of
unconsciousness.

I hear something more. When even the Aissaoua have sunk into sleep, I still see
moving forms. A breath steals across the terraces, disturbing the calm. I know.
I imagine. I hear. There are signs and catchings of breath out there in the
cinnamon-scented night. The heat of rut under the quiet stars. The not night's
languor drives flesh to seek flesh, and desire is reborn. It is terrible to
hear teeth grinding in mortal spasms, and lungs making sounds like
death-rattles. Agony! I feel like sinking my teeth into the warm earth.

In the morning the west wind arrived suddenly. You could see it coming, raising
high spirals of dust, black as smoke. As it moved towards us through the calm
air, it made great sighing sounds. And then it was howling like a living thing.
I had a fantasy of being lifted up and carried off in the enormous embrace of
a winged monster, come to destroy us all. And the sand showered into the
terraces with the steady, small sound of rain.

-Isabelle Eberhardt, 1877-1904.
